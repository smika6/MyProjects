WASHINGTON (CNN) -- This is a transcript of the speech Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, gave Thursday after being elected speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives:

Thank you, Leader Boehner, Mr. Speaker.

I accept this gavel in the spirit of partnership, not partisanship, and I look forward to working with you, Mr. Boehner, and the Republicans in the Congress for the good of the American people.

After giving this gavel away in the first two -- in the last two Congresses, I'm glad someone else has the honor today.

In this House we may be different parties but we serve one country. And our pride and our prayers are united behind our men and women in uniform.

They are working together to protect the American people. And in this Congress we must work together to build a future worthy of their sacrifice.

Tribute to Ford

In this hour we need and pray for the character, courage and civility of a former member of this House: President Ford. He healed the country when it needed healing. This is another time, another war and another trial of our American will, imagination and spirit.

Let us honor his memory not just in eulogy but in dialogue and trust across the aisle.

I want to join Leader Boehner in expressing our condolences and our appreciation to Mrs. Ford and to the entire Ford family for their decades of leadership and service to our country.

With today's convening of the 110th Congress we begin anew. I congratulate all members of Congress on your election. I especially want to congratulate our new members of Congress.

The genius of our founders was that -- let's hear it for our new members of ...

The genius of our founders was that every two years new members would bring to this House their spirit of renewal and hope for the American people. This Congress is reinvigorated, new members, by your optimism and your idealism, and your commitment to our country.

Nod to family

Let us acknowledge your families, whose support have made your leadership possible today -- to your families.

Each of us brings to this Congress our shared values, our commitment to the Constitution, and our personal experience.

My path to Congress and to the speakership began in Baltimore, where my father was the mayor. I was raised in a large family that was devoutly Catholic, deeply patriotic, very proud of our Italian-American heritage and staunchly Democratic.

My parents taught us that public service was a noble calling and that we had a responsibility to help those in need. I viewed them as working on the side of the angels, and now they are with them.

But I am so happy that my brother Tommy D'Alesandro, who was also a mayor of Baltimore, is here leading the D'Alesandro family from Baltimore today.

He's sitting right up there with Tony Bennett.

Forty-three years ago Paul Pelosi and I were married. We raised our five children in San Francisco, where Paul was born and raised. I want to thank Paul and our five children -- Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul Jr. and Alexandra -- and our magnificent grandchildren -- for their love, for their support and the confidence they gave me to go from the kitchen to the Congress.

And I thank my constituents in San Francisco and for the state of California for the privilege of representing them in Congress.

Saint Francis of Assisi is our city's patron saint. And his ""Song of Saint Francis"" is our city's anthem: ""Lord, make me a channel of thy peace; where there is darkness may we bring light, where there is hatred may we bring love, where is despair may we bring hope.""

Hope: That is what America is about. And it is in that spirit that I serve in the Congress of the United States.

First female speaker

And today I thank my colleagues. By electing me speaker you have brought us closer to the ideal of equality that is America's heritage and America's hope.

This is an historic moment, and I thank the leader for acknowledging it. Thank you, Mr. Boehner.

It's an historic moment for the Congress. It's an historic moment for the women of America.

It is a moment for which we have waited over 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights.

But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal.

For our daughters and our granddaughters today we have broken the marble ceiling.

For our daughters and our granddaughters now the sky is the limit. Anything is possible for them.

The election of 2006 was a call to change, not merely to change the control of Congress but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in the war in Iraq.

The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.

Shortly, President Bush will address the nation on the subject of Iraq. It is the responsibility of the president to articulate a new plan for Iraq that makes it clear to the Iraqis that they must defend their own streets and their own security, a plan that promotes stability in the region and a plan that allows us to responsibly redeploy our troops.

Let us work together to be the Congress that rebuilds our military to meet the national security challenges of the 21st century.

Let us be the Congress that strongly honors our responsibility to protect the American people from terrorism.

Let us be the Congress that never forgets our commitment to our veterans and our first responders, always honoring them as the heroes that they are.

'A new America'

The American people also spoke clearly for a new direction here at home. They desire a new vision, a new America built on the values that have made our country great.

Our founders envisioned a new America driven by optimism, opportunity and strength. So confident were they in the America that they were advancing that they put on the seal, the great seal of the United States, ""novus ordo seclorum"" -- a new order for the centuries -- centuries. They spoke of the centuries -- that they envisioned America as a just and good place, as a fair and efficient society, and as a source of opportunity for all.

This vision has sustained us for over 200 years, and it accounts for what is best in our great nation: liberty, opportunity and justice.

Now it is our responsibility to carry forth that vision of a new America into the 21st century.

A new America that seizes the future and forges 21st-century solutions through discovery, creativity and innovation, sustaining our economic leadership and ensuring our national security.

A new America with a vibrant and strengthened middle class for whom college is affordable, health care is accessible and retirement reliable.

A new America that declares our energy independence, promotes domestic sources of renewable energy and combats climate change. A new America that is strong, secure and a respected leader among the community of nations. And the American people told us they expected us to work together for fiscal responsibility, with the highest ethical standard and with civility and bipartisanship.

After years of historic deficits this 110th Congress will commit itself to a higher standard: Pay as you go; no new deficit spending.

Our new America will provide unlimited opportunity for future generations, not burden them with mountains of debt.

In order to achieve our new America for the 21st century we must return this House to the American people. So our first order of business is passing the toughest congressional ethics reform in history.

This new Congress doesn't have two years or 200 days. Let us join together in the first 100 hours to make this Congress the most honest and open Congress in history.

One hundred hours.

This openness requires respect for every voice in the Congress. As Thomas Jefferson said, every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle.

My colleagues elected me to be speaker of the House, the entire House. Respectful of division of our founders, the expectations of our people and the great challenges that we face, we have an obligation to reach beyond partisanship to work for all America.

Let us stand together to move our country forward, seeking common ground for the common good.

We have made history. Now, let us make progress for the American people.

May God bless our work, and may God bless America.

Crescent City under evacuation; storm may overwhelm levees

This animated satellite image taken Sunday evening shows Katrina approaching the Gulf Coast. RELATED HURRICANE KATRINA 12 p.m. ET Sunday



Position of center: 90 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River



Latitude: 27.8 north



Longitude: 89.4 west



Top sustained winds: near 160 mph

NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- New Orleans braced for a catastrophic blow from Hurricane Katrina overnight, as forecasters predicted the Category 5 storm could drive a wall of water over the city's levees.

The huge storm, packing 160 mph winds, is expected to hit the northern Gulf Coast in the next nine hours and make landfall as a Category 4 or 5 hurricane Monday morning.

The National Hurricane Center reports that conditions are already deteriorating along the central and northeastern coast. (Watch video to see the worst case scenario)

New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin declared a state of emergency Sunday and ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city. (Watch video of mayor's announcement)

""This is a threat that we've never faced before,"" Nagin said. ""If we galvanize and gather around each other, I'm sure we will get through this.""

He exempted essential federal, state, and local personnel; emergency and utility workers; transit workers; media; hotel workers; and patrons from the evacuation order.

About 1.3 million people live in New Orleans and its suburbs, and many began evacuating before sunrise. (Watch video to see who's staying and who's leaving)

Nagin estimated that nearly 1 million people had fled the city and its surrounding parishes by Sunday night. (Watch time lapse video of the evacuation)

Between 20,000 and 25,000 others who remained in the city lined up to take shelter in the Louisiana Superdome, lining up for what authorities warned would be an unpleasant day and a half at minimum.

City officials told stranded tourists to stay on third-floor levels or higher and away from windows. (See video from New Orleans, a city below sea level)

Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco said that New Orleans could expect a complete loss of electricity and water services as well as intense flooding.

""We know we're going to have property damage,"" she told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""We know we're going to have high wind damage. We're hoping we're not going to lose a lot of lives.""

About 70 percent of New Orleans is below sea level, and is protected from the Mississippi River by a series of levees. (Full story)

Forecasters predicted the storm surge could reach 28 feet; the highest levees around New Orleans are 18 feet high.

Hurricane-force winds extend 105 miles from the center of the mammoth storm and tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles. It is the most powerful storm to menace the central Gulf Coast in decades.

Isolated tornadoes are also possible Sunday across southern portions of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, forecasters said.

Federal Emergency Management Agency teams and other emergency teams were in place to move in as soon as the storm was over, FEMA Undersecretary Michael Brown said.

Katrina is blamed for at least seven deaths in Florida, where it made landfall Thursday as a Category 1 hurricane. As much as 18 inches of rain fell in some areas, flooding streets and homes. (See video of the damage floodwaters left in one family's new house)

At midnight ET, Katrina was centered about 90 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River. It was moving to the northwest at about 10 mph.

National Hurricane Center Director Max Mayfield said: ""There's certainly a chance it can weaken a bit before it gets to the coast, but unfortunately this is so large and so powerful that it's a little bit like the difference between being run over by an 18-wheeler or a freight train. Neither prospect is good."" (Watch Mayfield's assessment of Katrina)

Bush issues disaster declarations

President Bush announced Sunday that he had issued disaster declarations for Louisiana, Mississippi and parts of southern Florida. The declaration for Miami-Dade and Broward counties in Florida will allow residents there to apply for federal disaster aid.

""We'll do everything in our power to help the people and communities affected by this storm,"" he said.

The president urged anyone in the storm's path ""to put their own safety and the safety of their families first by moving to safe ground.""

Jesse St. Amant, the emergency management chief for Louisiana's southernmost Plaquemines Parish, said nearly 95 percent of the parish's 27,000-plus residents had fled by Sunday afternoon. Those who remained were being told that they are ""gambling with their own lives.""

""I think they just don't believe something of this nature can ever happen in their lifespan, and I think they're going to be wrong,"" he said.

As far east as Mobile, Alabama, 118 miles away from New Orleans, authorities warned of storm surges approaching 20 feet.

""I'm afraid most people look at the map and say, 'It's going to New Orleans, we're all right,'"" said Mobile Mayor Mike Deal. ""We're in harm's way with the current path of this storm.""

Hurricane warnings are posted from Morgan City, Louisiana, eastward to the Alabama-Florida state line, including New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain. This means winds of at least 74 mph are expected in the warning area within the next 24 hours.

A tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch are in effect from the Alabama-Florida state line eastward to Destin, Florida, and from west of Morgan City to Intracoastal City, Louisiana. A tropical storm warning is also in effect from Intracoastal City, Louisiana, west to Cameron, Louisiana, and from Destin, Florida, eastward to Indian Pass, Florida.

A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions, including winds of at least 39 mph, are expected within 24 hours. A hurricane watch means hurricane conditions are possible, usually within 36 hours.

Category 5 is the most intense on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Only three Category 5 hurricanes have made landfall in the United States since records were kept. Those were the Labor Day hurricane of 1935, 1969's Hurricane Camille and Hurricane Andrew, which devastated the Miami area in 1992. Andrew remains the costliest U.S. hurricane on record, with $26.5 billion in losses.

Camille came ashore in Mississippi and killed 256 people.",https://www.cnn.com/2005/WEATHER/08/28/hurricane.katrina/
CNN,Japan Earthquake & Tsunamis,"Widespread destruction from Japan earthquake, tsunamis","Editor's Note: Read live blogging of the Japan tsunami and earthquake. Are you there? Send your video, pictures to iReport.

Tokyo (CNN) -- The morning after Japan was struck by the most powerful earthquake to hit the island nation in recorded history and the tsunami it unleashed -- and even as the earth continued to twitch with aftershocks -- the disaster's massive impact was only beginning to be revealed.

Rescue efforts began with the first light as military helicopters plucked survivors from roofs and carried them to safety.

The 8.9-magnitude temblor, which was centered near the east coast of Japan, killed hundreds of people, caused the formation of 30-foot walls of water that swept across rice fields, engulfed entire towns, dragged houses onto highways, and tossed cars and boats like toys. Some waves reached six miles (10 kilometers) inland in Miyagi Prefecture on Japan's east coast.

""The earth shook with such ferocity,"" said Andy Clark, who said he had gotten used to earthquakes during his 20 years in Japan but never experienced what he felt Friday at the airport outside Tokyo. ""I thought things were coming to an end ... it was simply terrifying.""

Buildings shook, heaved and collapsed by the score, and numerous fires ignited.

Hundreds more people were missing, Japanese media reported, citing local and national police. Tens of thousands of people were displaced, according to Japan's Kyodo News Agency.

Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the ""enormously powerful"" earthquake had caused ""tremendous damage over a wide area.""

The quake, which struck at 2:46 p.m. (12:46 a.m. ET), prompted the U.S. National Weather Service to issue tsunami warnings for at least 50 countries and territories.

The epicenter of Friday's main quake was located off Miyagi Prefecture, about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of Tokyo, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

Also in Miyagi, officials reported that a train had derailed and authorities had lost contact with four trains in coastal areas, Kyodo reported, citing the East Japan Railway Company.

Six million households, more than 10% of the total in Japan, were without electricity, said Japan's ambassador to the United States, Ichiro Fujisaki.

In Tokyo, rail service was suspended overnight, elevated highways were shut early Saturday and surface streets remained jammed as commuters -- thousands of whom had spent the night in shelters -- tried to get to their homes in outlying areas.

Video aired by Japanese broadcaster NHK showed extensive fires in Miyagi and in the port city of Hakodate, in the southern part of Hokkaido island in northern Japan. An oil refinery was burning in Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo, according to NHK. And Kyodo News said fires could be seen in extensive areas of Kesennuma in Miyagi.

Aerial views of Kesennuma showed plumes of white smoke emanating from the center of the city and large, black areas the flames had already traversed.

In the city of Minamisoma in Fukushima Prefecture, all that was left of many structures were their foundations. Only concrete and steel buildings appeared to have withstood the wash. No people were visible in the streets of the town, whose population on Friday had been 70,000.

And a dam in Fukushima Prefecture failed, washing away homes, Kyodo reported. There was no immediate word of casualties, but the Defense Ministry said 1,800 homes were destroyed.

The National Weather Service sent a warning to 50 countries and territories it said could be affected by the tsunami.

Scores of aftershocks jarred the country Saturday, punctuated by a pair of strong earthquakes in the early morning, including one with a magnitude of 7.1 and another with a magnitude of 6.8.

A leak occurred in an atomic power plant in northeast Japan, a spokesman for Japan's nuclear agency said Saturday. Cooling equipment stopped working when generators failed in the quake, and the temperature inside the plant in the Fukushima prefecture had risen; officials lowered the pressure inside the plant hangar by venting it, said spokesman Kazuo Kodama.

But high levels of radiation led officials to suspend the release, NHK said. Alternative plans were being evaluated, the broadcaster said.

Citing Japan's nuclear safety agency, Kyodo said radiation levels were 1,000 times above normal in the the control room of the facility's reactor.

An evacuation order was extended to people who live within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of the plant, named Fukushima Daiichi, about 160 miles (260 kilometers) north of Tokyo.

The agency said the radiation amount posed no immediate threat to the health of nearby residents, Kyodo reported.

Cooling problems also appeared to have affected to another of the Tokyo Electric Power Company's nuclear facilities.

Kyodo reported the power company alerted authorities that the cooling system at three units of another plant in the same prefecture. That prompted Japanese authorities to add that plant to its emergency list, along with the another plant, Kyodo said.

Prime Minister Kan inspected the plant and the rest of the affected region from a helicopter.

The government ordered the evacuation of residents nearest the plant as efforts to keep it cool after it was shut were initially hampered.

Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported Saturday that the death toll is more than 900, with about 700 others reported missing. Earlier Saturday the nation's Kyodo News News Agency, citing police, reported that the death toll was 433, with at least 784 missing.

The official death toll is likely to rise as authorities continue rescue and relief efforts in the worst-hit areas. Kyodo predicted the death toll would surpass 1,000.

The news agency, citing Japan's defense forces, also said 60,000 to 70,000 people were being evacuated to shelters in the Sendai area of Miyagi Prefecture.

The prime minister said an emergency task force had been activated, and he appealed for calm. The government dispatched 8,000 troops to assist in the recovery effort and asked for U.S. military assistance, according to Kyodo.

A spokesman for the U.S. military bases in Japan said all service members were accounted for and there were no reports of damage to installations or ships.

By early Saturday, more than 50 countries had offered help, said Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. U.S. President Barack Obama offered his condolences and said the United States was standing by to help ""in this time of great trial.""

The U.S. Navy initiated reconnaissance flights to map the disaster zone and was moving the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan into position to assist the Japanese government with relief efforts, defense officials said.

Images from Japanese media and CNN iReporters showed smoke pouring from buildings and water rushing across fields, carrying away entire structures.

""I wasn't scared when it started ... but it just kept going and going,"" said Michelle Roberts, who lives in central Tokyo. ""I won't lie, it was quite scary. But we are all OK. We live on the third floor, so most everything shook and shifted.""

The quake toppled cars off bridges and into waters underneath. Waves of debris flowed like lava across farmland, pushing boats, houses and trailers in their paths.

The quake also disrupted rail service and affected air travel. Hundreds of flights were canceled, Kyodo said. Some 13,000 people were stranded at the Narita airport, and 10,000 were stuck at the Haneda airport, the news agency said. Flights into and out of both airports had resumed Saturday.

At Tokyo Station, one of Japan's busiest subway terminals, shaken commuters grabbed one another to stay steady as the ground shook. Dazed residents poured into the streets, and offices and schools were closed. Children cried.

""This was larger than anyone expected and went on longer than anyone expected,"" said Matt Alt, who lives in Tokyo.

""My wife was the calm one. ... She told us to get down and put your back on something, and leave the windows and doors open in case a building shifts so you don't get trapped.""

The magnitude of the earthquake and its shallow depth -- 15.2 miles (24.5 kilometers) -- created a lot of energy, said Shenza Chen of the U.S. Geological Survey.

The impact was felt far and wide. In McKinleyville, California, a wave swept three men into the Pacific Ocean as they were reportedly trying to take photos of the incoming tsunami waves, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.

Two of the men returned to shore, but one died, officials said.

Japanese government officials said large tsunami waves were still a risk to coastal Japan, and they urged residents in coastal areas to move to higher ground.

The tsunami brought waves of nearly 7 feet to a harbor in Maui, authorities said, but other areas reported lower levels.

On the U.S. mainland, wave heights from Alaska to California ranged from less than a foot to more than 8 feet. The highest measurement, 8.1 feet, was at Crescent City, California.

Tsunamis are a series of long ocean waves that can last five to 15 minutes and cause extensive flooding in coastal areas. Sometimes, the waves hit in succession -- often the highest not being the first, CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said.

Humanitarian agencies were working with rescue crews to reach people affected by the earthquake and tsunami.

""When such an earthquake impacts a developed country like Japan, our concern also turns to countries like the Philippines and Indonesia, which might not have the same resources,"" said Rachel Wolff, a spokeswoman for World Vision.

Wolff said her agency is helping people in Japan and teaming up to help others in countries along the path of the tsunami.

The quake was the latest in a series around Japan this week.

On Wednesday, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Honshu, the country's meteorological agency said. Early Thursday, an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.3 struck off the same coast.

Friday's quake is the strongest earthquake in recorded history to hit Japan, according to U.S. Geologic Survey records. The previous record was an 8.6-magnitude earthquake that struck near the Chubu Region near southwestern Honshu on October 28, 1707, that may have killed 5,000 people, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said.

That quake generated a 33-foot (10-meter) tsunami wave, and some scientists believe the quake may have triggered the eruption of Mount Fuji 49 days later, Morris said.

The world's largest recorded quake took place in Chile on May 22, 1960, with a magnitude of 9.5, the USGS said.

CNN,BP Oil Spill,"As oil spill nears Gulf Coast, experts issue dire warnings","Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- Gulf coast residents braced Saturday for the arrival of a massive oil slick creeping toward shore as nearly a million feet of boom were deployed in an effort to protect precious estuaries and wildlife -- even as thousands of barrels of crude continued gushing into the water.

Landfall along the Mississippi River Delta and other Gulf areas was expected as early as Saturday.

""I'm pretty much on pause right now ... it's just a big waiting game,"" said David Boola, a fisherman who leads boat trips for tourists out of Venice, Louisiana.

But even as officials and residents wait for the oil to reach land, the slick has already taken a dramatic toll on life all along the Gulf Coast, bringing fishing and tourism to a halt in many places and threatening to cripple those industries for weeks to come.

""I'm extremely worried because I have customers that [have] already canceled trips,"" Boola told CNN Saturday. ""I should be out taking people fishing today and I'm not. I'm not making money today. Or tomorrow. I'm worried about the now factor, you know?""

Government leaders echoed those fears.

""The oil that is leaking offshore, the oil that is coming onto our coast threatens more than just our wildlife, our fisheries, our coast,"" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said at a Saturday press conference. ""This oil literally threatens our way of life.""

The oil company BP -- which operated the rig whose sinking caused the underwater oil gusher -- partnered with government officials to hold town hall meetings throughout the region Saturday to respond to concern about the spill's consequences.

But frustration was growing Saturday in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. At a town hall meeting in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, Mayor Stan Wright warned fishermen in the audience that outbursts would be met with arrest. The fishermen were told that they were not allowed to ask questions.

Jindal suggested the response to the oil slick has so far been inadequate, saying ""we continue to be concerned with BP's ability to respond to this incident.""

Jindal said he has been working with local officials to develop cleanup contingency plans, but needs funding approval from BP and authorization from the U.S. Coast Guard's incident commander to move forward.

""We need to empower our locals on the ground,"" he said.

""Now they're saying we are seeing sheens,"" hitting the coast, Jindal said Saturday, citing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""But they expect the heavier oil to be coming by tomorrow and Monday.""

U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Thad Allen -- who the Obama administration designated Saturday to lead response to the oil slick -- said that oil is likely to reach shorelines in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.

""The real question is when,"" he said.

Allen said Saturday that the government and BP's top priority is trying to stop the oil leak, but offered no timetable for when that goal might be achieved.

""We don't know how many days the discharge will continue to occur,"" he said.

Such reports darkened forecasts about the spill's environmental impact.

""This has the potential of being truly devastating,"" Tom McKenzie, of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told CNN.

Environmentalist Richard Charter of the Defenders of Wildlife organization said the magnitude of the oil leak could cause damage that would last decades.

""This event is a self-feeding fire,"" Charter told CNN. ""It is so big and expanding so fast that it's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective. ... You're looking at a long-term poisoning of the area. Ultimately, this will have a multi-decade impact.""

President Obama announced he will visit the oil spill area Sunday morning.

The oil spill started April 20, after an explosion on the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven oil rig workers remain missing and are presumed dead.

The rig sank April 22 about 50 miles (80 km) off the southeast coast of Louisiana, and the untapped wellhead is gushing about 5,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico, according to BP and government estimates. Some environmentalists say the amount could be much larger.

About 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion, the Coast Guard said.

BP said two Louisiana communities -- Venice and Port Fourchon -- will be the first places likely hit by the oil slick.

Nearly 2,000 personnel have joined the response effort, which includes 68 vessels, among them skimmers, tugs, barges and oil-recovery ships, officials said.

Crews worked through Friday night to dispense 3,000 gallons of sub-surface dispersant, officials said. The Coast Guard's Allen said that an initial test of dispersant released near the wellhead suggested the method could ""significantly mitigate the amount [of oil] that makes it to the surface.""

Such tests have never been done before, BP spokeswoman Marti Powers said. She said that the dispersants attach themselves to underwater concentrations of oil, causing the oil to sink to the bottom and dissipate.

While the dispersants can help dissipate oil slicks and help birds and other land-based or water-surface wildlife, the chemicals can hurt fish and other underwater species, environmentalist Charter said.

""The scale of the event and the likely duration of the event ... really leaves responders with no good options,"" Charter said. ""While [dispersants] can protect terrestial wildlife ... out in the ocean they make toxic biocomponents available to the marine food chain.""

Rapid response teams are staged to deploy to shorelines affected by the oil, federal officials said Saturday. The teams will evaluate and determine an appropriate clean-up effort to minimize impact on the environment.

In addition, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has approved Jindal's request to mobilize 6,000 National Guard troops.

Meanwhile, the Minerals Management Service has been in contact with all oil and gas operators in the oil spill area, officials said. Two platforms have stopped production and one has been evacuated as a safety measure, federal officials said in a release Saturday morning.

Federal officials have urged BP to beef up its response.

""We'll continue to urge BP to leverage additional assets,"" Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said Friday as she toured the area. ""It is time for BP to supplement their current mobilization as the slick of oil moves toward shore.""

Doug Suttles, chief operating officer of BP, said the company has had three priorities: stop the flow of oil, minimize its impact and keep the public informed.

""We've so far mounted the largest response effort ever done in the world,"" Suttles said. ""We've utilized every technology available, we've applied every resource request. ... We welcome every new idea and every offer of support.""

BP said it has been trying to stop the flow by using remote-controlled submarines to activate a valve atop the well. But the valve is not working, the energy company said.

As concerns about the spill's toll mount -- particularly in the commercial fishing industry, a critical $2.4 billion economic engine for the region -- Obama promised steps to prevent a similar disaster in the future.

The president asked Interior Secretary Ken Salazar ""to conduct a thorough review of this incident and report back to me in 30 days on what, if any, additional precautions and technologies should be required to prevent accidents like this from happening again.""

Federal officials, including the president, emphasized that BP is legally responsible for paying the costs of the response to and cleanup of the spill.

The cause of the blast on the Deepwater Horizon remains unknown.

Seventeen of the 126 people on the rig were injured in the blast, three of them critically. One person remained hospitalized Saturday, federal officials said.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee is investigating.

CNN,Swine Flu,"H1N1 death toll estimated at 3,900 in U.S.","Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Nearly 3,900 people, including about 540 children, are believed to have died from the H1N1 flu in the first six months of the epidemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.

The figure is a sharp increase from previous counts of laboratory-confirmed cases. But Dr. Anne Schuchat, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the estimate gives a ""more accurate picture"" of the scale of the pandemic.

The figure was based on a detailed analysis of data from several dozen districts around the country, she said. The method used to calculate the mortality figures is similar to that used to produce estimates of ordinary seasonal flu deaths, which are believed to number about 36,000 a year.

An estimated 22 million people in the United States have contracted the virus, commonly known as swine flu, resulting in about 98,000 hospitalizations through October 17, Schuchat said.

Among children under 18, about 8 million are believed to have been sickened, 36,000 have been hospitalized and 540 have died, a much higher number than the 129 laboratory-confirmed child deaths the CDC reported November 6.

About 12 million adults up to age 64 had been reported ill, with 53,000 hospitalizations in that age group and 2,900 deaths. People over age 65 accounted for 2 million illnesses, 9,000 hospitalizations and 440 deaths, Schuchat said.

The prevalence of flu cases is higher than at any time since the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, she said, but the death rate is ""nowhere near the severity of the 1918 pandemic.""

Schuchat said 41.6 million doses of H1N1 vaccine are now available, up from 38 million last week, but ""not as much as we'd hoped to have by today."" She told reporters last week that about 8 million new doses were expected this week.

The Department of Health and Human Services has ordered 75 million doses of swine flu vaccine for delivery by year's end, and the CDC had predicted that 40 million doses would be available by the end of October.

Production delays have hampered agency plans, and the lag has led to criticism of the program. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday found Americans are starting to lose confidence in the government's ability to prevent a nationwide epidemic, though a narrow majority continue to say that the government and private industry will eventually produce enough of the vaccine to inoculate everyone who wants it.",http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/11/12/h1n1.flu.deaths/index.html
CNN,Hussein Executed,Hussein executed with 'fear in his face',"Story Highlights • NEW: Iraqi TV airs video of noose placed around Hussein's neck

• Hussein refused to wear black hood

• Bush praises Iraqis for giving fair trial

• Celebrations break out in Baghdad and Michigan



Adjust font size:

BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Saddam Hussein, the former Iraqi dictator who spent his last years in captivity after his ruthless regime was toppled by the U.S.-led coalition in 2003, was hanged before dawn Saturday for crimes committed in a brutal crackdown during his reign.

The execution took place shortly after 6 a.m. (10 p.m. Friday ET), Iraq's national security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, told Iraqi television.

""This dark page has been turned over,"" Rubaie said. ""Saddam is gone. Today Iraq is an Iraq for all the Iraqis, and all the Iraqis are looking forward. ... The [Hussein] era has gone forever."" (Watch noose placed around Hussein's neck )

Al-Iraqiya state television aired videotape of Hussein's last moments several hours after the execution.

The video showed Hussein, dressed in a black overcoat, being led into a room by three masked guards.

The broadcast only showed the execution to the point where the noose was placed over Hussein's head and tightened around his neck. No audio was heard.

Rubaie, who witnessed the execution, said the former leader was ""strangely submissive"" to the process.

""He was a broken man,"" he said. ""He was afraid. You could see fear in his face.""

Rubaie said that Hussein carried with him a copy of the Quran and asked that it be given to ""a certain person."" Rubaie did not identify that person.

On Al-Arabiya television, Rubaie said the execution took place at the 5th Division intelligence office in Qadhimiya. He said Hussein refused to wear a black hood over his head before execution and told him ""don't be afraid."" (Watch Rubaie describe Hussein's final moments )

White House deputy press secretary Scott Stanzel said President Bush was asleep when the execution took place and was not awakened. The president had been briefed by national security adviser Stephen Hadley before retiring and was aware the hanging was imminent, Stanzel said.

The White House issued a statement praising the Iraqi people for giving Hussein a fair trial.

""Fair trials were unimaginable under Saddam Hussein's tyrannical rule,"" Bush's statement read. ""It is a testament to the Iraqi people's resolve to move forward after decades of oppression that, despite his terrible crimes against his own people, Saddam Hussein received a fair trial."" (Full story)

The execution took place outside the heavily fortified Green Zone, Rubaie said, and no Americans were present.

""It was an Iraqi operation from A to Z,"" he said. ""The Americans were not present during the hour of the execution. They weren't even in the building.""

He added that ""there were no Shiite or Sunni clerics present, only the witnesses and those who carried out the actual execution were present.""

Hussein was hanged for his role in the 1982 Dujail massacre, in which 148 Iraqis were killed after a failed assassination attempt against the then-Iraqi president. (Watch what happened in Dujail )

Two other co-defendants -- Barzan Hassan, Hussein's half-brother, and Awwad Bandar, the former chief judge of the Revolutionary Court -- were also found guilty and had been expected to face execution with Hussein, but Rubaie said their executions were postponed.

""We chose to postpone Barzan and Awwad's execution to a later date because we wanted to have this day to have an historic distinction,"" he said. ""We wanted to have one specific date for Saddam so people remember this date to be linked to Saddam's execution and nothing else.""

Rubaie said the execution was videotaped and photographed extensively from the time Hussein was transferred from U.S. to Iraqi custody until he was dead.

Many of those who witnessed the execution celebrated in the aftermath. (Full story)

""Saddam's body is in front me,"" said an official in the prime minister's office when CNN telephoned. ""It's over.""

In the background, Shiite chanting could be heard. When asked about the chanting, the official said, ""These are employees of the prime minister's office and government chanting in celebration."" (Watch what Hussein's death could mean in Iraq )

He said that celebrations broke out after Hussein was dead, and that there was ""dancing around the body.""

Iraqi-Americans celebrated in the street in Dearborn, Michigan, home to the largest concentration of Iraqis in the United States. (Watch Iraqi-Americans dancing, kissing and singing in the streets )

Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki did not attend the execution, according to an adviser to the prime minister who was interviewed on state television.

""It's a very solemn moment for me,"" Feisal Istrabadi, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, said on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""I can understand why some of my compatriots may be cheering. I have friends whose particular people I can think of who have lost 10, 15, 20 members of their family, more.

""But for me, it's a moment really of remembrance of the victims of Saddam Hussein.""

Friday evening, a U.S. district judge refused a request to stay the execution.

Attorney Nicholas Gilman said in an application for a restraining order, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Washington, that a stay would allow Hussein ""to be informed of his rights and take whatever action he can and may wish to pursue.""

Munir Haddad, a judge on the appeals court that upheld the former dictator's death sentence, called Gilman's filing ""rubbish,"" and said, ""It will not delay carrying out the sentence,"" which he called ""final.""

Throughout the day, there were conflicting reports about who had custody of Hussein. Giovanni di Stefano, one of Hussein's defense attorneys, told CNN the U.S. military officially informed him that the former Iraqi dictator had been transferred to Iraqi custody, but that the move in U.S. court could have meant that Hussein was back in U.S. custody.

There had been speculation that Hussein would be executed before Eid Al-Adha -- a holiday period that means Feast of the Sacrifice, celebrated by Muslims around the world at the climax of the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The law does not permit executions to be carried out during religious holidays.

Eid began Saturday for Sunnis and begins Sunday for Shiites. It lasts for four days. Hussein was a Sunni Muslim.

Meeting with half-brothers

Another defense lawyer, Badie Aref, told CNN that Hussein met with two of his half-brothers in his cell on Thursday and passed on messages and instructions to his family.

""President Saddam was just bracing for the worst, so he wanted to see his brothers and pass on some messages and instructions to his family,"" Aref said. The half brothers who visited were Sabawi and Wathban Ibrahim Hassan al-Tikriti, he said.

He never asked to see anyone else -- not even his wife, said his lawyers. She was the mother of his five children.

Aref said the U.S. soldiers guarding Hussein on Tuesday took away a radio he kept in his cell so he could not hear news reports about his death sentence, which was confirmed that day.

""They did not want him to hear the news from the appeals court upholding the sentence,"" he said. ""They gave him back the radio on Wednesday.""

Aref said Saddam found out about the appeals court verdict ""a few hours after it was announced.""

Crimes against humanity

Hussein was convicted on November 5 of crimes against humanity in connection with the killings of 148 people in the town of Dujail after an attempt on his life.

The dictator was found guilty of murder, torture and forced deportation.

The Dujail episode falls within 12 of the worst cases out of 500 documented ""baskets of crimes"" during the Hussein regime.

The U.S. State Department says torture and extrajudicial killings followed the Dujail killings and that 550 men, women and children were arrested without warrants.

Story highlights Clinton outpaced Trump by almost 2.9 million votes She lost the Electoral College, however

CNN —

More Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than any other losing presidential candidate in US history.

The Democrat outpaced President-elect Donald Trump by almost 2.9 million votes, with 65,844,954 (48.2%) to his 62,979,879 (46.1%), according to revised and certified final election results from all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Clinton’s 2.1% margin ranks third among defeated candidates, according to statistics from US Elections Atlas. Andrew Jackson won by more than 10% in 1824 but was denied the presidency, which went to John Quincy Adams. In 1876, Samuel Tilden received 3% more votes than Rutherford B. Hayes, who eventually triumphed by one electoral vote.

Though the legitimacy of his victory has never come into serious doubt, Trump has repeatedly argued, usually via Twitter, that he would have won the popular vote, too, if that had been his focus.

“I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote – but would campaign differently,” he tweeted as recently as Wednesday morning, more than six weeks after the election. In late November, Trump also falsely claimed that “millions” of Clinton voters had cast ballots “illegally.”

Meanwhile, high-profile Clinton supporters have held up the dissonant results as an argument for fundamentally changing the system.

A week after the election, retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat and vocal Clinton backer, introduced a bill to abolish the Electoral College.

“This is the only office in the land where you can get more votes and still lose the presidency,” Boxer said in a statement. “The Electoral College is an outdated, undemocratic system that does not reflect our modern society, and it needs to change immediately.”

Two days later, New York Congressman Charlie Rangel put forth companion legislation in the House of Representatives.

Measuring the electoral margin

In the final count, Clinton surpassed President Barack Obama’s 2012 total by 389,944 votes, but narrow losses in key battleground states meant Obama won 100 more electoral votes on Election Day.

Trump’s victories in swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida – all carried by Obama four years ago – gave him a comfortable edge in the Electoral College. Still, Trump’s claims of a “massive landslide victory” are belied by past statistics, which place his win among the narrowest.

If all the electors had voted in accordance with their states’ results during meetings on Monday, Trump would have garnered 56.9% – or 306 – of the 538 available electoral votes. Two defections lowered his final share to 56.5%. Clinton won 232 electoral votes on November 8, but “faithless electors” also brought down her total.

The 2016 electoral votes will be counted on January 6 by a Joint Session of Congress, with Vice President Joe Biden presiding over the largely symbolic meeting. Trump will be inaugurated on January 20 in Washington.",https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/21/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-popular-vote-final-count/index.html

CNN,London Olympics ,London 2012 legacy: Trust the British to get it right,"Story highlights Quest: Britain has brought the Olympics Games back a dose of sanity Though criticized, the £9.3 billion cost was put to good use at a time of stimulus spending IOC President Jacques Rogge: ""London has created a legacy blueprint"" Challenge for UK civic and political leaders: Harness Britain's Olympic pride

Editor’s Note: Richard Quest is CNN’s foremost international business correspondent and presenter of Quest Means Business. He also is a British citizen and no pretense is made that this article is even-handed or neutral. Follow him on Twitter.

London CNN —

Trust the British to get it right – in the end. When it comes to taking stock on London 2012, I believe the London Games will be regarded as having brought the Olympics concept home.

Britain has brought the Olympics back to what they have been and should always be. And we did it with that unique common sense for which my country is known.

To be sure, the London Games were not as spectacular as, say Beijing. Nor did they have the exotic “new world” quality of Sydney so wonderfully laced with Australian freshness. They haven’t been the biggest, the brightest, the tallest, the largest, the (you add your own superlative here).

Instead, they have been what they were always meant to be – a celebration of athletic prowess infused with a tremendous sense of fun and good spirit emanating from the host nation’s culture.

CNN's Richard Quest

Everything that has been bad about games in recent years was slowly, carefully addressed and ultimately dealt with in London.

The opening ceremony set the tone. With its green fields and satanic mills, to the self-deprecating humor from the Monarch herself, London sent the not-so-subtle message: This wasn’t going to be “Olympics as usual.”

The Games’ big budgets

Montreal finally finished off paying for the 1976 games 30 years later in November 2006. Athens was twice over budget. And of course, we will never know how much the Beijing games truly cost.

In London an original, fictional bid-budget of £2.7 billion ($4.2 billion) was quickly abandoned in 2007 in favor of a realistic, £9.3 billion ($14.6 billion) with a huge contingency for unforeseen costs such as security.

To those who criticize the three-times bid-budget, there is one crucial fact to bear in mind.

In 2008, like other countries in recession, Britain embarked on stimulus spending. We were fortunate that we actually had real projects and purpose upon which to spend the cash, rather than the bridges and roads to nowhere of other countries. We didn’t have to invent places to spend the money because the Olympics was waiting. If there was ever a time to have the Olympics, this was it – when the expenditure was economically needed.

In fact, the contingency money allocated has proved to be more than enough. A political row is about to break out over what to do with the £300 million under-spend and whether it should just be handed back to the cash-strapped UK Treasury. My own view is some of it should be used for a tourism campaign next year to help bring those guests who stayed away fearing the crowds.

The Olympic legacy

Olympics today are all about legacy. It was the prospect of regenerating London’s derelict East End which helped win the games. Since then billions of pounds have been spent, not just on the facilities per se, but on the infrastructure around them. And in the city, those of us who live here and have suffered years of weekend closure of tube lines for “scheduled maintenance” and “replacing signals” can be in no doubt we will reap the benefits once everyone has gone home. We have a regenerated subway that is once again world-class.

So when the IOC President Jacques Rogge said, “London has created a legacy blueprint” and “has raised the bar on how to deliver a lasting legacy,” we can neatly tick that one off as a rousing success from which other cities can learn.

Organizational triumph

From day one, Britain was determined not to have another Wembley fiasco, or Millennium Dome disaster, where it seemed every major construction project ended up delayed, over budget and in acrimony (incidentally the Dome is now the most successful concert venue in Europe as the O2 arena – so there!)

With the Olympics, we simply got on with it. The Aquatics Centre, designed by Zaha Hadid, was completed and tested a year before the games began. The Olympic Stadium had the lights switched on by the Prime Minister back in December and its final test was four months before the opening ceremony.

In fact the IOC never did doubt everything would be ready.

London has conclusively shown that by being more realistic in ambition, everything can be done without the heartache and angst of previous games.

For the British people themselves, there has been a renewed pride in the country – helped of course by record gold medals. I accept this might be a mile wide but an inch deep, but I cannot recall the last time I have seen so many people proudly walking the streets with the Union Jack flag wrapped around their shoulders. The legacy of confidence means it is the challenge of politicians and civic leaders to foster that spirit so it doesn’t disappear along with the fleeting summer sun.

Every time London has hosted the games it has done so in testing times. In 1908 London rescued the Olympics after Mount Vesuvius volcano erupted, causing the selected city of Rome to pull out. In 1948 London hosted the so-called “Austerity Games” three years after the end of WWII. They were the first Olympics in 12 years.

So re-establishing the Olympics is something of a tradition here. To this we now add 2012, where I gently suggest London has subtly re-established the Olympic tradition by bringing back a dose of sanity. We have proved, firstly, that the Olympics are manageable, and affordable, if done right. We have proved they can be fun for everyone (even the people who live in the city).

London will probably never host the games again. I was proud to be in the stadium on Saturday night singing our national anthem after Mo Farah won his second gold medal. Just as I have been proud to be here, in my capital city, to see us get it right and leave a legacy for the city, the country and the games themselves.",https://www.cnn.com/2012/08/12/sport/london-olympics-close-quest/index.html

CNN —

Two bombs struck near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday, turning a celebration into a bloody scene of destruction.

Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said Monday night that the death toll had risen to three. Scores were injured at the scene.

One of the dead was an 8-year-old boy, according to a state law enforcement source.

Hospitals reported at least 144 people are being treated, with at least 17 of them in critical condition and 25 in serious condition. At least eight of the patients are children.

At least 10 people injured had limbs amputated, according to a terrorism expert briefed on the investigation.

Several of the patients treated at Massachusetts General Hospital suffered injuries to lower limbs that will require “serial operations” in the coming days, trauma surgeon Peter Fagenholz said Monday night. Some injuries were so severe amputations were necessary, Fagenholz added.

Full horror of the day emerges in emergency rooms

In Washington, President Barack Obama vowed, “Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups, will feel the full weight of justice.”

Boston “is a tough and resilient town,” he said, adding that Americans will stand by Bostonians “every single step of the way.”

’Like a huge cannon’

The terrorist attack, near the marathon’s finish line, triggered widespread screaming and chaos, shattered windows and barricades and sent smoke billowing into the air at Copley Square.

The blasts were about 50 to 100 yards apart, officials said, on a stretch of the marathon course lined with spectators cheering runners through the final yards of a 26-mile, 385-yard endurance feat.

“It felt like a huge cannon,” a witness told CNN about one of the blasts.

Allan Panter, a doctor who was near the finish line waiting for his wife to finish the race, told CNN he was standing about 20 to 25 feet from the first blast. He said he treated victims on the street after the explosion.

“I saw at least six to seven people down next to me,” he said. “They protected me from the blast. One lady expired. One gentleman lost both his (lower) limbs. Most of the injuries were lower extremities.”

Flights banned over Boston Marathon blast site

Bill Iffrig, 78 and a veteran marathoner, was nearing the finish when “the shock waves just hit my whole body and my legs just started jittering around.” Iffrig, who can be seen in video of the explosion wearing an orange tank top, was helped to his feet by an event volunteer and had just a scratch from his fall, he told CNN.

Federal authorities are classifying the bombings as a terrorist attack, but it’s not clear whether the origin was domestic or foreign, a federal law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation said.

A federal law enforcement official told CNN that both bombs were small, and initial tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive material, suggesting that the packages used in the attack were crude explosive devices.

Another explosive device found

Authorities in Boston found at least one other explosive device that they were dismantling, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said.

Rep. Bill Keating of Massachusetts, meanwhile, said two more were found.

One unexploded device was found at a hotel on Boylston Street near the bomb site and another unexploded device was found at an undisclosed location, Keating, a Democrat and member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said. He called the bombing a “sophisticated, coordinated, planned attack.”

FBI to take lead in investigation, seeks bomb ‘signature’

It was unclear who may have planted the marathon bombs. There were no credible threats before the race, a state government official said.

There is no suspect in custody, but many people are being questioned, Davis said.

Investigators warned police to be on the lookout for a “darker-skinned or black male” with a possible foreign accent in connection with the attack, according to a law enforcement advisory obtained by CNN. The man was seen with a black backpack and sweatshirt and was trying to get into a restricted area about five minutes before the first explosion, the lookout notice states.

Also, a Saudi national with a leg wound was under guard at a Boston hospital in connection with the bombings, but investigators cannot say he is involved at this time and he is not in custody, a law enforcement official said Monday evening.

In addition to scrutinizing images of surveillance cameras in the area, the FBI likely was issuing subpoenas for records from cell towers in the area to isolate and trace calls from around Copley Square at the time of the blasts, according to a former federal law enforcement official who now works in the intelligence community.

The unexploded devices that were recovered could provide a treasure trove of information such as fingerprints and indications of the bomb maker’s design, and from the bombs that did explode, investigators would be looking for fragments and anything indicating the “signature” of the bomb makers, the official told CNN.

As authorities searched the scene, numerous suspicious packages were found, possibly because people fled the area, leaving items behind. Investigators were checking them.

All off-duty Boston police were called in.

The Marriott hotel at Copley Place was evacuated as a precaution.

The Lenox Hotel was also evacuated as a precaution, the Boston Globe reported.

’Horrific day’

Crowds were in the area watching the runners take part in the world’s oldest annual marathon.

It was also Patriots Day, commemorating the opening battle of the Revolutionary War.

Within seconds, the festive occasion turned into devastation.

“This is a horrific day in Boston,” Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said in a statement.

“My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been injured. I have been in touch with the president, Mayor (Thomas) Menino and our public safety leaders. Our focus is on making sure that the area around Copley Square is safe and secured. I am asking everyone to stay away from Copley Square and let the first responders do their jobs.”

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke with FBI Director Robert Mueller and U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, a Justice Department official said.

Holder has directed the full resources of the Justice Department to be deployed to ensure the matter is fully investigated, the official said.

The Federal Aviation Administration placed a flight restriction over the site of the blasts.

Other cities, including New York and Washington, tightened security as a result. Following standard protocol, the White House cleared out an area in front of the West Wing.

Mike Baingon, who works at the Atlantic Fish Company in Boston, said an explosion took place in front of the restaurant and that he was right by the front door at the time.

The explosions occurred at about 2:45 p.m., more than two hours after the first of the race’s nearly 27,000 runners had crossed the finish line, CNN Producer Matt Frucci reported.

The race was halted as was subway service into the area.

Troops from the Massachusetts National Guard, already at the site as part of the marathon’s security and crowd-management plan, were assisting police as well.

Eyewitness: ‘I saw blood everywhere’

CNN,Area 51 Raid,There were (thankfully) fewer alien enthusiasts than authorities expected. There were arrests and a Naruto runner,"Rachel, Nevada (CNN) — The day we had all been waiting for is finally here -- but it wasn't as exciting as expected. And that's probably for the best.

Two million people had pledged to storm Area 51 , the highly classified US Air Force facility in Nevada, on Friday to ""see them aliens.""

Instead, many of the 3,000 or so people that showed up in surrounding areas decided against storming the mystifying location, the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office said.

""They did threaten that they were going to storm,"" Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee said. ""Once officers warned them about the consequences for storming the base, they did have second thoughts.""

There was one alcohol-related arrest and a Canadian citizen was also arrested for indecent exposure, Lee said. One woman came close to crossing and she was briefly detained and released at the scene.

The sheriff said the Nevada Highway Patrol had also made a couple of arrests.

'Come, look, see'

The crowd was ""very manageable for emergency services,"" Lee said, adding it was nowhere near the number of people initially expected.

""The crowd has been good,"" he said. ""Officers have been mingling with the crowds and the crowds have been positive and so far it's been really well.""

But they expect more people to show up throughout the day and night, the sheriff said, and are keeping their guard up.

Lee's advice: ""Come, look, see what you can see, but just don't cross.""

Many of the campers told CNN they had no plans to go through with the raid Friday.

Mary Ramirez, sporting an alien-themed T-shirt and alien sunglasses, said she thought storming Area 51 would be a bad idea.

""You think I'm crazy?,"" she said.

One Arizona resident said he came out for the fun of it.

""Just like this thing said, everybody's always wondered, are they really holding aliens down there,"" the camper said.

The Facebook event's creator had already disavowed the whole thing and the page was taken down. But that didn't stop alien enthusiasts from dedicating the day to our fellow galaxy residents. There were multiple events planned around the base and many attendees camped out in nearby highways, enjoying a sunny day and a drink.

So, how did all the hullabaloo get started?

The creator underestimated the allure

Matty Roberts was just joking. He didn't believe anyone would take him seriously when, on June 27, he created a Facebook page for an event entitled ""Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us.""

But Roberts may have underestimated the allure of Area 51, the highly classified US Air Force base in southern Nevada. It's long been a topic of fascination for conspiracy theorists and paranormal enthusiasts who believe it to be the location where the US government stores and hides alien bodies and UFOs. Just this week, the US Navy acknowledged that some videos of UFO s are indeed images of objects that can't be identified.

Roberts said he came up with the idea for the meme page after podcaster Joe Rogan interviewed Area 51 whistleblower Bob Lazar and filmmaker Jeremy Corbell. Lazar claims that he worked with an alien spacecraft while he was employed in one of Area 51's underground facilities.

CNN's Nick Watt explores the ""Storm Area 51"" event that took social media by storm, and how the locals plan to respond to an influx of alien enthusiasts to their town.

The Air Force didn't see the joke in any of this and promised to stand ""ready to protect America and its assets,"" so Roberts switched tactics. He started promoting a music festival, Alienstock, to be held this weekend in Rachel, Nevada, one of the closest towns to the base. But he pulled out of the festival last week, because he feared it would turn into a ""humanitarian disaster.""

""Due to the lack of infrastructure, poor planning, risk management and blatant disregard for the safety of the expected 10,000+ AlienStock attendees, we decided to pull the plug on the festival,"" he wrote on a website for the festival. (Roberts set up a separate festival, the Area 51 Celebration , in downtown Las Vegas.)

But Alienstock will go on in Rachel, as well as other events in the nearby town of Hiko, and that's what has local officials worried. They're afraid that some people really will try to ""storm"" the desert base or put themselves in danger trying.

There are not enough accommodations

Local authorities and the community spent the past few weeks preparing for Friday.

Rachel has a population of 54 and is surrounded by ghost towns and desert. The town boasts only four businesses in its city limits, and the Little A'Le'Inn is the only one that provides lodging and food.

According to its website, the inn is ""booked solid."" The inn has 14 rooms, and camping space is now the last available option.

Early Friday, the sheriff's office reported there were 2,000 people in Rachel. There were another 250 were in Hiko.

""Vehicle traffic is starting to get heavy coming in to the area,"" the sheriff's office said . ""Please use extreme caution and plan ahead for delays in travel.""

To make matters worse, Rachel's only gas station closed in 2006, so visitors will have to fill their tanks 50 miles away in Alamo, Nevada.

Two people had already tried to get on the base earlier this month. Two Dutch men were arrested about three miles deep into the Nevada National Security Site, which is near Area 51. They pleaded guilty to trespassing and illegal parking. They told authorities they just wanted to get a good look at Area 51.

Washington CNN —

In a landmark opinion, a divided Supreme Court on Friday ruled that same-sex couples can marry nationwide, establishing a new civil right and handing gay rights advocates a historic victory.

In the 5-4 ruling, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority with the four liberal justices. Each of the four conservative justices wrote their own dissent.

Nearly 46 years to the day after a riot at New York’s Stonewall Inn ushered in the modern gay rights movement, the decision could settle one of the major civil rights fights of this era. The language of Kennedy’s opinion spoke eloquently of the most fundamental values of family, love and liberty.

READ: The Supreme Court’s full decision

“No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family,” Kennedy wrote. “In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than they once were.”

’Equal dignity in the eyes of the law’

“Their hope,” Kennedy wrote, “is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.”

Kennedy has written the opinion in significant gay rights cases and when he uttered the key sentence that same-sex couples should be able to exercise the right to marry in all states, people in the Court’s public gallery broke into smiles and some wiped tears from their eyes.

Reaction: People soak up history from coast to coast

In a dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia blasted the Court’s “threat to American democracy.”

“The substance of today’s decree is not of immense personal importance to me,” he wrote. “But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today’s judicial Putsch.”

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the decision had “nothing to do with the Constitution.”

READ: The best lines from Scalia’s marriage dissent and Kennedy’s decision

“If you are among the many Americans—of whatever sexual orientation—who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today’s decision. Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal,” he wrote. “Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it.”

The U.S. is now the 21st country to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, including territories. Married same-sex couples will now enjoy the same legal rights and benefits as married heterosexual couples nationwide and will be recognized on official documents such as birth and death certificates.

Hundreds of same-sex marriage supporters flooded the plaza and sidewalk in front of the Court to celebrate the ruling, proudly waving rainbow flags and banners with the Human Rights Campaign’s equal sign, which have come to represent the gay rights movement. In an emotional moment, the supporters sang the National Anthem, clapping wildly after singing that the U.S. is “the land of the free.”

WATCH: Obama calls gay marriage case plaintiff Jim Obergefell

After the ruling, President Barack Obama called Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the case, while he and his supporters celebrated the ruling outside the court.

Obama: ‘Congratulations’

“I just wanted to say congratulations,” Obama said as CNN broadcast his warm words to Obergefell over speakerphone. He added: “Your leadership on this has changed the country.”

01:58 - Source: CNN Obama calls same-sex marriage plaintiff after victory

Speaking at the White House later in the morning, Obama said “Americans should be very proud,” because small acts of courage “slowly made an entire country realize that love is love.”

By the numbers: Same-sex marriage

The decision affirmed growing public support in the U.S. for gay marriage, with about two-thirds of Americans now in favor. And it comes as gay rights groups have seen gay marriage bans fall rapidly in recent years, with the number of states allowing gay marriage swelling most recently to 37 – that is, until this ruling.

There were two questions before the Court, the first asked whether states could ban same sex marriage, the second asked whether states had to recognize lawful marriages performed out of state.

The relevant cases were argued earlier this year. Attorney John Bursch, serving as Michigan’s Special Assistant Attorney General, defended four states’ bans on gay marriage before the Court, arguing that the case was not about how to define marriage, but rather about who gets to decide the question.

The case came before the Supreme Court after several lower courts overturned state bans on gay marriage. A federal appeals court had previously ruled in favor of the state bans, with Judge Jeffrey Sutton of the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals writing a majority opinion in line with the rationale that the issue should be decided through the political process, not the courts.

14 couples

Fourteen couples and two widowers challenged the bans. Attorneys Mary Bonauto and Doug Hallward-Driemeier presented their case before the Court, arguing that the freedom to marry is a fundamental right for all people and should not be left to popular vote.

Three years after Obama first voiced his support for gay couples’ right to marry, his administration supported the same sex couples at the Supreme Court.

“Gay and lesbian people are equal,” Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. told the justices at the oral arguments earlier this year. “It is simply untenable – untenable – to suggest that they can be denied the right of equal participation in an institution of marriage, or that they can be required to wait until the majority decides that it is ready to treat gay and lesbian people as equals.

MAP: Where same-sex marriage is recognized in the U.S.

Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the case, married his spouse John Arthur in 2013 months before Arthur died.

The couple, who lived in Ohio, had to travel to Maryland aboard a medical jet to get married when Arthur became gravely ill. And when Arthur died, Obergefell began to fight to be recognized as Arthur’s spouse on his death certificate.

The plaintiffs from Michigan are April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, two Detroit-area nurses who are also foster parents. They took to the courts after they took in four special-needs newborns who were either abandoned or surrendered at birth, but could not jointly adopt the children because Michigan’s adoption code requires that couples be married to adopt.

Milestones for LGBT rights

Sgt. Ijpe Dekoe and Thomas Kostura became plaintiffs in the gay marriage case after they moved to Tennessee from New York.

The pair had married in New York in 2011, but Dekoe’s position in the Army took the couple to Tennessee, which banned gay marriage and refused to recognize gay marriages performed in other states.

2016

Republicans seeking the White House struggled to find their footing after the ruling.

Candidates running closer to the center, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, issued tightly-parsed language urging their colleagues to focus on protecting “religious freedom”. And Ohio Gov. John Kasich urged Republicans to respect the ruling and ditch the matter altogether.

“In a country as diverse as ours, good people who have opposing views should be able to live side by side. It is now crucial that as a country we protect religious freedom and the right of conscience and also not discriminate,” Bush said in his statement.

But conservative firebrands, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, said that conservatives must stand and fight by seeking a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.

“I will not acquiesce to an imperial court any more than our founders acquiesced to an imperial British monarch. We must resist and reject judicial tyranny, not retreat,” Huckabee said in a statement.

Democrats had no problem reacting, jumping fast on Twitter to express their universal elation.

Washington CNN —

President Donald Trump has nominated Brett Kavanaugh to join the US Supreme Court, setting the stage for a dramatic confirmation battle over a stalwart conservative who could shape the direction of the court for decades to come.

If confirmed, Kavanaugh would replace a frequent swing vote on the bench, retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, who often sided with his liberal colleagues on issues such as abortion, affirmative action and LGBT rights.

Kavanaugh, 53, is a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and Yale Law School graduate who previously served in both Bush administrations. He also worked on independent counsel Ken Starr’s investigation of President Bill Clinton.

“What matters is not a judge’s political views, but whether they can set aside those views to do what the law and the Constitution require. I am pleased to say I have found without doubt such a person,” Trump said as he announced Kavanaugh’s nomination at the White House Monday evening.

Trump called Kavanaugh “one of the finest and sharpest legal minds of our time,” saying he is “considered a judge’s judge and a true thought leader among his peers.”

“Judge Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials, unsurpassed qualifications and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law,” Trump said.

Kavanaugh will begin meeting with senators on Tuesday.

He has never expressed outright opposition to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which made abortion legal nationwide, and similarly has no record on gay rights and same-sex marriage, but he will face tough questions from Democrats on both issues. Kavanaugh has also suggested that presidents be shielded from civil and criminal litigation until they leave office, an issue that could be front and center as Trump faces the investigations by special counsel Robert Mueller and potential civil challenges.

“If confirmed by the Senate, I will keep an open mind in every case,” Kavanaugh said Monday at the White House.

The nomination is Trump’s second to the nation’s highest court, a rare presidential privilege that could seal a key part of Trump’s legacy less than two years into his first term.

GOP hoping for quick confirmation

Trump last week spoke with seven candidates, all drawn from a shortlist compiled by the conservative Federalist Society, about the Supreme Court. The nomination also comes just before the President leaves for a critical trip to Britain, a NATO summit in Belgium and a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The White House is hoping the Senate moves quickly to confirm Kavanaugh before the midterm elections in November threaten to unfurl the narrow Republican majority in the chamber and nix the precious leverage the GOP holds over some red state Democrats up for reelection in 2018.

Trump’s legislative affairs director Marc Short told reporters Monday night that the White House expects a confirmation vote before October 1, when the new Supreme Court term begins.

Democrats are warning that Trump’s nominee would jeopardize some of progressives’ most important policy priorities in recent decades – including rulings that legalized abortion and same-sex marriage, as well as former President Barack Obama’s health care law.

Republicans hold 51 seats in the Senate, though Arizona Sen. John McCain has been absent as he battles brain cancer. Trump’s nominee can win confirmation with only Republican votes, but attention will quickly shift to two moderate GOP senators, Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, who are supportive of abortion rights.

Trump also hopes to pressure several Democrats into voting to confirm his nominee. Three Democrats up for re-election in states Trump won by double digits in 2016 – Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp – voted “yes” on the confirmation of his first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, who once held a court seat open for nearly a year before the 2016 election to keep President Barack Obama from filling it, lambasted Democrats for announcing their opposition before Trump had decided on a nominee.

“Justice Kennedy’s resignation letter barely arrived in the President’s hands before several Democratic colleagues began declaring their blanket opposition to anyone at all – anyone – that the President might name,” McConnell said Monday.

The sharply negative Democratic responses to Kavanaugh’s nomination indicated a pitched battle over his confirmation is coming this fall.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that by selecting Kavanaugh, Trump “has put reproductive rights and freedoms and health care protections for millions of Americans on the judicial chopping block.”

“This nomination could alter the balance of the court in favor of powerful special interests and against working families for a generation, and would take away labor, civil, and human rights from millions of Americans. We cannot let that happen,” the New York Democrat said.

Red-state Democrats keep their distance

Trump had invited four Democrats from deep-red states – likely the four best chances the White House has of attracting Democratic votes for Kavanaugh – to Monday night’s announcement.

But Alabama’s Sen. Doug Jones, Indiana’s Sen. Joe Donnelly, North Dakota’s Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and West Virginia’s Sen. Joe Manchin all declined the invitations.

Donnelly, Heitkamp and Manchin are up for re-election this fall, three of the five Democrats, along with Missouri’s Sen. Claire McCaskill and Montana’s Sen. Jon Tester, up for re-election in states Trump won by double digits in 2016.

Most of those Democrats issued tepid statements saying they will review Kavanaugh’s record, without commenting on whether they will vote for or against his confirmation – a position that breaks with their party’s progressive flank, which is demanding an all-out battle, but also doesn’t promise Trump any Democratic votes.

Donnelly said he would “carefully review and consider the record and qualifications.” Tester said he looks forward to meeting Kavanaugh and called on senators in both parties to “put politics aside and do what’s best for this nation.”

Moderate Republicans also held their fire. Collins said she is waiting for Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and to meet the nominee in her office.

“I will conduct a careful, thorough vetting of the President’s nominee to the Supreme Court, as I have done with the five previous Supreme Court Justices whom I have considered,” she said in a statement.

Veteran of DC

Kavanaugh is a classic Washington insider with a deep conservative legal record.

He worked in the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, serving the younger president when he was torn among finalists for a Supreme Court seat in 2005.

He also spent 12 years on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where his record would place him to Kennedy’s right and more in ideological sync with Justice Samuel Alito, who has been a reliable conservative vote on the court.

Last October, Kavanaugh dissented when the full DC Circuit prevented the Trump administration from blocking a pregnant teenage migrant at the southern border from obtaining an abortion. Kavanaugh stressed that the “government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of a minor, and refraining from facilitating abortion.”

George W. Bush praised Trump’s selection of Kavanaugh in a statement, calling his selection an “outstanding decision.”

“Brett is a brilliant jurist who has faithfully applied the Constitution and laws throughout his 12 years on the D.C. Circuit. He is a fine husband, father, and friend – and a man of the highest integrity,” Bush said. “He will make a superb justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.”

At the White House, Kavanaugh described his mother as influential in his legal path. After teaching high school history, she went to law school, became a prosecutor and later a state court judge during his youth, and he said he thinks of her as the real “Judge Kavanaugh.”

“Her trademark line was, ‘Use your common sense – what rings true, what rings false.’ That’s good advice for a juror and for a son,” he said.

Says presidents should be shielded from litigation while in office

No stranger to controversy, including on issues that resonate today, Kavanaugh worked for Starr’s investigation of Clinton in the 1990s. That initial Whitewater real estate inquiry expanded into an investigation of Clinton’s relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

The then 33-year-old Kavanaugh became a lead author of the 1998 Starr Report that detailed Clinton’s sexual involvement with Lewinsky and laid out 11 grounds for Clinton’s impeachment, including obstruction of justice and lying under oath. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives voted to impeach Clinton, but the GOP-controlled Senate acquitted him in 1999.

A decade later, after Kavanaugh had worked closely with George W. Bush, he wrote in a law review that he had new appreciation for the demands of the presidency and the toll any legal proceeding could take on the White House. He recommended presidents be shielded from civil and criminal litigation until they leave office.

“Having seen first-hand how complex and difficult that job is,” he wrote, “I believe it vital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible.” He acknowledged that blocking litigation would suggest the President was “above the law,” but he added, “the point is not to put the President above the law or to eliminate checks on the President, but simply to defer litigation and investigations until the President is out of office.”

Kavanaugh noted in the 2009 Minnesota Law Review piece that a check against a “bad-behaving or law-breaking President” would still exist. “If the President does something dastardly, the impeachment process is available.”

CNN,Trump Inauguration,Inauguration Day 2017: Historic moment arrives,"Washington CNN —

Donald Trump became the 45th President of the United States on Friday, vowing to drain power from Washington elites and always put “America first” in its dealings with the world at a moment of transformative political change.

He arrived at the White House for the first time as President just before 5 p.m. ET following a day of tradition marking the power shift in the nation’s capital.

In a time-honored ceremony on the flag-draped West Front of the Capitol earlier in the afternoon, Trump placed his left hand on a family Bible and another that belonged to Abraham Lincoln and promised to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. As light rain began to fall on a crowd stretching toward the Washington Monument, Trump took the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts with the new first lady, Melania, by his side.

President Trump signs first bill into law

Trump’s inaugural address centered on the themes that animated his stunning outsider campaign, which shattered political conventions and gave voice to heartland voters who felt badly let down by professional politicians.

Though he paid tribute to outgoing President Barack Obama, the President sketched a vision of America that came across as a repudiation of the last administration. He promised to restore the nation’s strength and purpose and to rebuild it from within, vowing to “bring back” American jobs, borders, wealth and dreams.

Trump: ‘You will never be ignored again’

“We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, and in every foreign capital and in every hall of power,” Trump said. “From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land, from this day forward, it’s going to be only ‘America first! America first!’”

Trump talked of a nation of mothers and children trapped in poverty in the inner cities and “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones,” and warned crime and gangs had robbed the nation of much of its potential.

Trump’s full speech

“This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,” Trump said, with Obama looking on.

“A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights and heal our divisions,” Trump said, emphasizing that whether people are black or white they still bleed the same red blood of patriots.

And he told Americans listening to the address: “You will never be ignored again.”

Former Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter attended the ceremony. Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated in the November election, was in the audience in a show of support for national unity and the peaceful transfer of presidential authority.

But, contrary to some expectations, Trump made no gesture of reconciliation toward Clinton or her supporters following the deeply divisive campaign in which he won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote. He later recognized her during a congressional lunch, when she received a standing ovation.

“I was very honored, very, very honored when I heard that President Bill Clinton and Secretary Hillary Clinton was coming today, I think it is appropriate to say it,” Trump said. “Honestly, there is nothing more I can say because I have a lot of respect for those two people.”

Many traditions

The swearing-in was one of many traditions that began Friday morning. Trump and his family attended a private worship service at St. John’s Episcopal Church, known as the church of presidents. The Obamas greeted Trump and the new first lady at the North Portico of the White House before hosting them for tea.

Earlier in the morning, Obama wrote a letter to Trump and left it on the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, as outgoing presidents typically do for their successors. As Obama left the Oval Office for the final time, he was asked whether he had any words for the American people. “Thank you,” Obama responded.

The customs and symbolism that are playing out – from Trump’s ride to the Capitol with Obama to the first couple’s dance at an inaugural ball – are familiar. But the circumstances of this inauguration – the 58th in the nation’s history – could hardly be more unconventional.

Everything you need to know about Trump’s inauguration, weekend protests

When the presidential primary season began nearly a year ago, few thought Trump could survive the battle for the Republican nomination – much less beat Clinton to win the presidency. He was the oldest president sworn in for a first term and the first president with no previous diplomatic, political or military executive experience.

In what is always a poignant moment, the former President Obama and his wife left Capitol Hill on a helicopter bound for Joint Base Andrews for a farewell ceremony before taking one last flight on the presidential jet. The Obamas are heading to Palm Springs, California, for a vacation.

Trump attended a joint congressional inaugural luncheon in the Capitol before heading back to the White House for the inaugural parade. Halfway along Pennsylvania Avenue, Trump’s vehicle stopped and the new first couple walked hand in hand past the cheering crowds. By the time the motorcade approached the new Trump hotel, the President was back in the hulking car.

In the evening, Trump and the new first lady will attend two inaugural balls, part of the stripped-down inaugural festivities that aides say are meant to stress that the new president is eager to get to work.

Supporters excited; others concerned

Trump’s supporters, who sent him to Washington to rip up political norms and thwart the establishment, are thrilled as he assumes power. The crowds started streaming toward the National Mall as dawn broke, with many people wearing Trump’s distinctive red “Make America Great Again” baseball caps.

Day One: Trump says he will sign ‘very meaningful’ documents amid talk of executive orders

But millions of Americans are also anxious, owing to the abrasive tone of Trump’s campaign and fears over the consequences of his strongman leadership style.

Trump has vowed to tear up US trade deals that he says disadvantage US workers, confront a rising China and improve estranged relations with Russia, despite allegations that Moscow interfered in the election. He has set high expectations for his presidency by promising to return jobs to US shores and reviving the manufacturing industry. He has pledged to crush ISIS and introduce tough new vetting on immigrants from countries where there is terrorist activity, raising fears of discrimination against Muslims.

Trump is promising to build a wall on the southern border, to crack down on undocumented migrants and to gut the financial and environmental regulations that are at the center of the Obama administration’s legacy.

New presidents typically use the inaugural address – viewed by a huge crowd fanned out on the National Mall and millions of television viewers – to issue a call for national unity and ease the wounds of divisive elections. They typically remind Americans of the values and the history that binds them and of the nation’s historic mission.

Trump, so far, has done little to reach out to his foes since November.

“He is still talking as if he is the insurgent candidate rather than the President-elect,” said Robert Rowland, an expert on presidential rhetoric at the University of Kansas. “Historically, presidents who are effective use inaugural addresses to heal the wounds of the campaign, to talk about what it means to be an American, to discuss shared values and lay out their political principles to come across as a strong not vain leader.”",https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/politics/donald-trump-inauguration-highlights/index.html

Groups of demonstrators looted and damaged stores in the surrounding areas, according to CNN\'s observations.\r\nAn attorney representing Floyd\'s family, Benjamin Crump, said in a statement Wednesday that he and Floyd\'s relatives are calling for peaceful protests and social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n""We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,"" the statement said. ""We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.""\r\nThe four officers involved in Floyd\'s death were fired from the department Tuesday, Minneapolis police said.\r\nThe officers involved in the incident were identified by Minneapolis police as: Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J.

He said he made his opinion known to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, whose office would be in position to file state charges.\r\n""George Floyd deserves justice. His family deserves justice. The black community deserves justice, and our city deserves justice,"" Frey said.\r\nNo charges have been filed in the case.\r\nMinneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo declined to discuss Floyd\'s death on Wednesday but said the actions of the former police officers ""in no way reflect the values, and the vision and the culture"" he wants to change in the police department.\r\nOfficers should be charged with murder, family says\r\nFloyd worked security at Conga Latin Bistro in Minneapolis for five years, according to its owner, Jovanni Thunstrom.\r\nThe 46-year-old Houston native moved to Minneapolis for work and to drive trucks, his friend and former NBA player, Stephen Jackson said.\r\nMembers of Floyd\'s family remembered him as a man who wouldn\'t ""hurt anybody."" The family wants the four officers charged with murder.\r\n""They were supposed to be there to serve and to protect and I didn\'t see a single one of them lift a finger to do anything to help while he was begging for his life.

CNN,Russia Invades Ukraine,"U.S. official says 1,000 Russian troops enter Ukraine","b'A top Ukrainian army officer said a ""full-scale invasion"" of his country was under way Thursday, as a U.S. official said up to 1,000 Russian troops had crossed Ukraine\'s southern border to fight alongside pro-Russian rebels.\r\nU.S. officials said Russian troops were directly involved in the latest fighting, despite Moscow\'s denials.\r\nRebels backed by Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers fought Ukrainian forces on two fronts Thursday: southeast of rebel-held Donetsk, and along the nation\'s southern coast in the town of Novoazovsk, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the Russian border, said Mykhailo Lysenko, the deputy commander of the Ukrainian Donbas battalion.\r\n""This is a full-scale invasion,"" Lysenko said, referring to the fighting in the south.\r\nIntelligence now indicates that up to 1,000 Russian troops have moved into southern Ukraine with heavy weapons and are fighting there, a U.S. official told CNN on Thursday.\r\nNATO provided what it said is evidence: satellite images showing Russian troops engaged in military operations inside Ukraine.\r\n""The images, captured in late August, depict Russian self-propelled artillery units moving in a convoy through the Ukrainian countryside and then preparing for action by establishing firing positions in the area of Krasnodon, Ukraine,"" NATO said in a news release.\r\nSee the NATO satellite images\r\nCommercial satellite imagery shows the same, according to a British security source with detailed knowledge of UK intelligence estimates. One image that British intelligence has analyzed, dated Tuesday, shows 15 heavy trucks, at least seven armored vehicles and at least nine artillery positions.\r\nRussia\'s military actions in eastern Ukraine ""must cease immediately,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday.\r\n""I\'m extremely concerned by mounting evidence that Russian troops have made large-scale incursions into South Eastern Ukraine, completely disregarding the sovereignty of a neighbor,"" Cameron said. ""The international community has already warned Russia that such provocative actions would be completely unacceptable and illegal.""\r\nAs the Russian presence grows, so does its influence over the separatist leadership in Ukraine, the British security source told CNN.\r\nAccording to the source, the UK has determined that Russian artillery and rockets -- across the border and from within Ukraine -- have been fired against the Ukrainian military.\r\nTwo SA-22A gun/missile air defense systems were observed in separatist-controlled parts of Luhansk province on August 2, the source said. This system is not in Ukraine\'s inventory but is used by the Russian military.\r\nUkraine\'s National Defense and Security Council said that Russian forces were in full control of Novoazovsk as of Wednesday afternoon.\r\nRussia\'s military fired Grad rockets into the town and its suburbs before sending in two convoys of tanks and armored personnel carriers from Russia\'s Rostov region, it said in a statement\r\n""Ukrainian troops were ordered to pull out to save their lives. By late afternoon both Russian convoys had entered the town. Ukraine is now fortifying nearby Mariupol to the west,"" the NDSC said.\r\nA number of villages in the Novoazovsk, Starobeshiv and Amvrosiiv districts were also seized, it said.\r\nThe NDSC also warned that a rebel counterattack is expected in the area where Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in July. Ukrainian and Western officials say they believe it was downed by rebels armed with Russian-made weapons.\r\nNovoazovsk is strategically important because it lies on the main road leading from the Russian border to Ukraine\'s Crimea region, which Russia annexed in March. Separatist leaders in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions then declared independence from Kiev.\r\nU.N. Security Council meets\r\nAs international concern mounted over the apparent escalation in fighting, the U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting on Ukraine.\r\nSamantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, accused Russia of lying.\r\n""It has manipulated. It has obfuscated. It has outright lied. So we have learned to measure Russia by its actions and not by its words,"" Power said, calling for ""serious negotiations.""\r\n""In the face of this threat, the cost of inaction is unacceptable,"" she warned.\r\nAccording to Vitaly Churkin, Russia\'s ambassador to the United Nations, more than 2,000 people have been killed in the conflict and more than 800,000 have been displaced.\r\nHe blamed the current escalation on the ""reckless policy"" of Kiev.\r\n""The Kiev authorities have torpedoed all political agreements on resolving the crisis,"" Churkin told the Security Council meeting. ""The only thing we\'re seeing is a fight against dissent.""\r\nUkraine\'s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, meanwhile, put his colleagues on alert.\r\n""The world is challenged by a military-nuclear might, ignoring universal principles and craving absolute power,"" Oleksandr Pavlichenko said about Russia. ""How many more red lines have to be crossed before this challenge is addressed?"" he asked.\r\nThe latest flare-up comes despite a meeting between Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Belarus on Tuesday at which some progress appeared to have been made toward finding a diplomatic solution to the crisis.\r\nPoroshenko canceled a planned trip to Turkey on Thursday ""due to sharp aggravation of the situation in Donetsk region ... as Russian troops were brought into Ukraine,"" a statement from his office said.\r\nIn a Cabinet meeting, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said that Russia ""has very much increased its military presence in Ukraine"" and that tougher measures may be needed to curb Russia\'s support for the rebels.\r\n""Unfortunately, the sanctions were unhelpful as to de-escalating the situation in Ukraine,"" he said, referring to the economic sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union against Russian individuals and companies.\r\nYatsenyuk suggested one way to halt ""Russian aggression"" could be to freeze all assets and ban all Russian bank transactions until Russia ""pulls out all its military, equipment and agents"" from Ukraine.\r\n""Vladimir Putin has purposely started a war in Europe. It is impossible to hide from the fact,"" he said.\r\nPresident Barack Obama, similarly, placed blame for the violence in Ukraine on Russia.\r\n""The violence is encouraged by Russia. The separatists are trained by Russia; they are armed by Russia; they are funded by Russia,"" he told reporters in Washington.\r\nCalling sanctions against Russia already in place ""effective,"" he said it would face additional costs and consequences for its ongoing incursion.\r\n""Russia is already more isolated than at any time since the end of the Cold War,"" Obama said.\r\nU.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the flow of weapons is hindering efforts.\r\n""This remains a key obstacle to the de-escalation of the situation on the ground, as arms and heavy weaponry reportedly continue to flow unabated into Ukraine from Russia,"" Ban said. ""There is an urgent need to ensure a secure border between the two countries, with international verification.""\r\nU.S. ambassador: Russia is directly involved\r\nU.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt also said Thursday that Russian soldiers were directly involved in the fighting, alongside the pro-Russian rebels.\r\n""Russian-supplied tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and multiple rocket launchers have been insufficient to defeat Ukraine\'s armed forces, so now an increasing number of Russian troops are intervening directly in the fighting on Ukrainian territory,"" he said on Twitter.\r\n""Russia has also sent its newest air defense systems including the SA-22 into eastern Ukraine and is now directly involved in the fighting.""\r\nMoscow denies supporting and arming the pro-Russian rebels. It has also repeatedly denied allegations by Kiev that it has sent troops over the border.\r\nA Russian senator and the deputy head of the Committee on Defense and Security in Russia\'s upper house of Parliament, Evgeny Serebrennikov, dismissed the latest reports of a Russian incursion as untrue.\r\n""We\'ve heard many statements from the government of Ukraine, which turned out to be a lie. What we can see now is just another lie,"" he said to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\r\nRussian lawmaker Leonid Slutsky also accused Kiev of lies, in comments to RIA Novosti.\r\n""I can only say that there\'s no ground for claims like this, and the junta tries to lay its own fault at someone else\'s door,"" he said, referring to the Kiev government.\r\nMoscow regards it as illegitimate because it took charge after Ukraine\'s pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in February.\r\nRussian soldiers detained in Ukraine; leaders meet in Minsk\r\nRebel leader: 3,000 to 4,000 Russians in our ranks\r\nHowever, the Prime Minister of the self-declared Donetsk People\'s Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, acknowledged Thursday that there are current Russian servicemen fighting in the rebels\' ranks in eastern Ukraine.\r\nIn his statement, televised on state-run Russia 24, Zakharchenko said the rebels have never concealed that many Russians are fighting with them. He said up until now there were 3,000 to 4,000 volunteers, some of whom are retired Russian servicemen.\r\nZakharchenko went on to reveal that the Russian servicemen currently fighting in their ranks are active, ""as they came to us to struggle for our freedom instead of their vacations.""\r\nOn Tuesday, Ukraine\'s Security Service said it had detained 10 Russian soldiers in Ukraine.\r\nRussian state media cited a source in the Russian Defense Ministry as saying the soldiers had been patrolling the border and ""most likely crossed by accident"" at an unmarked point.\r\nThe NDSC said Thursday that Ukraine\'s Security Service detained another Russian serviceman who testified that his unit was supplying heavy military equipment to militants.\r\nSix questions -- what\'s happening in Ukraine?\r\nSeparately, Ukraine announced Thursday that it would reinstate compulsory military service in the fall.

Heavy Ukrainian artillery fire targeted areas near Donetsk\'s southern suburbs amid a heavy downpour of rain.\r\nThe main highway 9 miles (15 kilometers) south of Donetsk was deserted. With return fire coming from Donetsk, villagers in the area said they\'d been taking shelter indoors or underground, coming out only for an hour or two a day to get supplies.\r\nThe city of Luhansk, a rebel stronghold, has also been at the center of fighting for days, prompting a humanitarian crisis.

Fox News,Hurricane Katrina,Keeping the Record Straight on the Katrina Story,"Keeping the record straight on the Katrina story: that is the subject of this evening's ""Talking Points Memo"".

Ground zero for the hate Bush movement is The New York Times Company, but its behavior in the wake of the Hurricane Katrina is so over the top, one wonders if CEO Janet Robinson has lost control over her operation.

There's no question the Bush administration was slow in getting relief to the hurricane zone. That's a legitimate criticism, but the personal attacks on President Bush by The New York Times Company, which includes The Boston Globe are beyond the pale.

Some examples:

- Far-left Globe columnist James Carroll: ""The bystander-in-chief, of course, is George W. Bush, whose whining self-obsession perfectly embodies what America has done to itself.""

- Far-left Times columnist Bob Herbert: ""What we witnessed...was the dangerous incompetence and staggering indifference to human suffering of the president and his administration.""

- Far-left Times columnist Paul Krugman: ""The federal government's lethal ineptitude wasn't just a consequence of Mr. Bush's personal inadequacy; it was a consequence of ideological hostility to the very idea of using government to serve the public good.""

So what these Bush haters are saying is that the president doesn't care if people suffer and die, and has geared the U.S. government toward putting Americans in jeopardy.

That's beyond ridiculous. The truth is this. Governor Blanco of Louisiana did not have a disaster plan in place, did not have enough state police and National Guard to secure a city the size of New Orleans, and did not push for federal help soon enough. President Bush was 24 hours too slow in reacting to the disaster. Why? I don't know. And the head of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, seemed clueless for days.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Mr. Secretary, how is it possible that you could not have known on late Thursday, for instance, that there were thousands of people in the convention center, who didn't have food, who didn't have water, who didn't have security, when that was being reported on national television?

MICHAEL CHERTOFF, HOMELAND SECURITY: Well, Chris, you know, that's one of the issues we have to look at. I mean, we were in constant touch with what was going on in the field, getting information from state and local officials.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

So Chertoff is going to blame Louisiana. Louisiana is going to blame the Feds. So the bottom line, both were in chaos. And chaos is unacceptable in these dangerous times.

By the way, Michael Chertoff has consistently avoided confronting the border issue, which is another disaster just waiting to happen.

At this point, the office of Homeland Security does not inspire confidence, to say the least. You don't need personal attacks to make that point.

In another area that didn't take long before the race-hustlers hit the ground. They would have you believe reaction was slow because most of those stranded were black. Ultra-liberal columnist Jimmy Breslin said, ""If whites were in trouble in New Orleans, I trust that this government would have been there early.""

That is despicable nonsense. Newsday should be embarrassed for printing that kind of garbage. And NBC was embarrassed when rapper Kanye West (search) said this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KANYE WEST, RAPPER: The way America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off as slow as possible, they've given them permission to go down and shoot us. George Bush doesn't care about black people.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

NBC censored those remarks on the West Coast. And the remarks are simply nutty. I mean, come on, West is saying authorities want to shoot blacks? It doesn't get more irresponsible than that.

But what do you expect from an ideologically-driven newspaper industry and the world of rap, where anything goes? What do you expect?

""Talking Points"" wants to reinforce two things. First, the huge, bureaucratic government will never be able to protect you. If you rely on government for anything, anything, you're going to be disappointed, no matter who the president is.

For example, engineers knew for decades the levee system in Louisiana could not withstand a Category 5 hurricane, but nobody wanted to pony up the $20 billion to shore it up. That kind of decision happens all day, every day.

Second point, New Orleans is not about race. It's about class. If you're poor, you're powerless, not only in America, but everywhere on earth. If you don't have enough money to protect yourself from danger, danger's going to find you. And all the political gibberish in the world is not going to change that.

The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina should be taught in every American school. If you don't get educated, if you don't develop a skill, and force yurself to work hard, you're most likely be poor. And sooner or later, you'll be standing on a symbolic rooftop waiting for help.

Chances are that help will not be quick in coming.

And that's ""The Memo.""

The Most Ridiculous Item of the Day

Our great ally France has offered the following in the wake of Katrina: 600 tents, 1,000 cots, some kitchen kits, 60 generators and 12 experts to advise the American Red Cross. --I hope they speak English.

Now I believe the 4-H Club of Bangor, Maine, has topped that offer.

The boycott of France remains intact. Get your bumper stickers on billoreilly.com. To not do so would be ridiculous. Why do they even bother? -- Keep your cots.

Fox News,Hussein Executed,Saddam Hussein Executed by Hanging in Iraq,"Saddam Hussein, the shotgun-waving dictator who ruled Iraq with a remorseless brutality for a quarter-century, was taken to the gallows and executed Saturday, Iraqi state-run television reported.

It was a grim end for the 69-year-old leader who had vexed three U.S. presidents. Despite his ouster, Washington, its allies and the new Iraqi leaders remain mired in a fight to quell a stubborn insurgency by Saddam loyalists and a vicious sectarian conflict.

• Obituary: Saddam Hussein, 1937-2006

Also hanged were Saddam's half-brother Barzan Ibrahim and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, the former chief justice of the Revolutionary Court. State-run Iraqiya television news announcer said ""criminal Saddam was hanged to death and the execution started with criminal Saddam then Barzan then Awad al-Bandar.""

Mariam al-Rayes, a legal expert and a former member of the Shiite bloc in parliament, told Iraqiya television that the execution ""was filmed and God willing it will be shown. There was one camera present, and a doctor was also present there.""

• U.S. Forces Brace For Violence in Iraq Post-Execution

Al-Rayes, an ally of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, did not attend the execution. She said Al-Maliki did not attend but was represented by an aide.

The station earlier was airing national songs after the first announcement and had a tag on the screen that read ""Saddam's execution marks the end of a dark period of Iraq's history.""

• Iraqi-Americans Cheer Saddam's Execution

The execution came 56 days after a court convicted Saddam and sentenced him to death for his role in the killings of 148 Shiite Muslims from a town where assassins tried to kill the dictator in 1982. Iraq's highest court rejected Saddam's appeal Monday and ordered him executed within 30 days.

A U.S. judge on Friday refused to stop Saddam's execution, rejecting a last-minute court challenge.

Al-Maliki had rejected calls that Saddam be spared, telling families of people killed during the dictator's rule that would be an insult to the victims.

""Our respect for human rights requires us to execute him, and there will be no review or delay in carrying out the sentence,"" al-Maliki's office quoted him as saying during a meeting with relatives before the hanging.

The hanging of Saddam, who was ruthless in ordering executions of his opponents, will keep other Iraqis from pursuing justice against the ousted leader.

At his death, he was in the midst of a second trial, charged with genocide and other crimes for a 1987-88 military crackdown that killed an estimated 180,000 Kurds in northern Iraq. Experts said the trial of his co-defendants was likely to continue despite his execution.

Many people in Iraq's Shiite majority were eager to see the execution of a man whose Sunni Arab-dominated regime oppressed them and Kurds.

Before the hanging, a mosque preacher in the Shiite holy city of Najaf on Friday called Saddam's execution ""God's gift to Iraqis.""

""Oh, God, you know what Saddam has done! He killed millions of Iraqis in prisons, in wars with neighboring countries and he is responsible for mass graves. Oh God, we ask you to take revenge on Saddam,"" said Sheik Sadralddin al-Qubanji, a member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq.

On Thursday, two half brothers visited Saddam in his cell, a member of the former dictator's defense team, Badee Izzat Aref, told The Associated Press by telephone from the United Arab Emirates. He said the former dictator handed them his personal belongings.

A senior official at the Iraqi defense ministry said Saddam gave his will to one of his half brothers. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

In a farewell message to Iraqis posted Wednesday on the Internet, Saddam said he was giving his life for his country as part of the struggle against the U.S. ""Here, I offer my soul to God as a sacrifice, and if he wants, he will send it to heaven with the martyrs,"" he said.

One of Saddam's lawyers, Issam Ghazzawi, said the letter was written by Saddam on Nov. 5, the day he was convicted by an Iraqi tribunal in the Dujail killings.

The message called on Iraqis to put aside the sectarian hatred that has bloodied their nation for a year and voiced support for the Sunni Arab-dominated insurgency against U.S.-led forces, saying: ""Long live jihad and the mujahedeen.""

Saddam urged Iraqis to rely on God's help in fighting ""against the unjust nations"" that ousted his regime.

Najeeb al-Nauimi, a member of Saddam's legal team, said U.S. authorities maintained physical custody of Saddam until the execution to prevent him being humiliated publicly or his corpse being mutilated, as has happened to previous Iraqi leaders deposed by force. He said they didn't want anything to happen to further inflame Sunni Arabs.

""This is the end of an era in Iraq,"" al-Nauimi said from Doha, Qatar. ""The Baath regime ruled for 35 years. Saddam was vice president or president of Iraq during those years. For Iraqis, he will be very well remembered. Like a martyr, he died for the sake of his country.""

Iraq's death penalty was suspended by the U.S. military after it toppled Saddam in 2003, but the new Iraqi government reinstated it two years later, saying executions would deter criminals.

Saddam's own regime used executions and extrajudicial killings as a tool of political repression, both to eliminate real or suspected political opponents and to maintain a reign of terror.

In the months after he seized power on July 16, 1979, he had hundreds of members of his own party and army officers slain. In 1996, he ordered the slaying of two sons-in-law who had defected to Jordan but returned to Baghdad after receiving guarantees of safety.

Saddam built Iraq into a one of the Arab world's most modern societies, but then plunged the country into an eight-year war with neighboring Iran that killed hundreds of thousands of people on both sides and wrecked Iraq's economy.

During that war, as part of the wider campaign against Kurds, the Iraqi military used chemical weapons against the Kurdish town of Halabja in northern Iraq, killing an estimated 5,000 civilians.

The economic troubles from the Iran war led Saddam to invade Kuwait in the summer of 1990, seeking to grab its oil wealth, but a U.S.-led coalition inflicted a stinging defeat on the Iraq army and freed the Kuwaitis.

U.N. sanctions imposed over the Kuwait invasion remained in place when Saddam failed to cooperate fully in international efforts to ensure his programs for creating weapons of mass destruction had been dismantled. Iraqis, once among the region's most prosperous, were impoverished.

The final blow came when U.S.-led troops invaded in March 2003. Saddam's regime fell quickly, but political, sectarian and criminal violence have created chaos that has undermined efforts to rebuild Iraq's ruined economy.

While he wielded a heavy hand to maintain control, Saddam also sought to win public support with a personality cult that pervaded Iraqi society. Thousands of portraits, posters, statues and murals were erected in his honor all over Iraq. His face could be seen on the sides of office buildings, schools, airports and shops and on Iraq's currency.

Fox News,Swine Flu,Government to Intensely Track for H1N1 Shot Side Effects,"More than 3,000 people a day have a heart attack. If you're one of them the day after your H1N1 flu shot, will you worry the vaccine was to blame and not the more likely culprit, all those burgers and fries?

The government is starting an unprecedented system to track possible side effects as mass flu vaccinations begin next month. The idea is to detect any rare but real problems quickly, and explain the inevitable coincidences that are sure to cause some false alarms.

""Every day, bad things happen to people. When you vaccinate a lot of people in a short period of time, some of those things are going to happen to some people by chance alone,"" said Dr. Daniel Salmon, a vaccine safety specialist at the Department of Health and Human Services.

Health authorities hope to vaccinate well over half the population in just a few months against swine flu, which doctors call the 2009 H1N1 strain. That would be a feat. No more than 100 million Americans usually get vaccinated against regular winter flu, and never in such a short period.

How many will race for the vaccine depends partly on confidence in its safety. The last mass inoculations against a different swine flu, in 1976, were marred by reports of a rare paralyzing condition, Guillain-Barre syndrome.

""The recurring question is, 'How do we know it's safe?'"" said Dr. Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic.

Enter the intense new monitoring. On top of routine vaccine tracking, there are these government-sponsored projects:

_Harvard Medical School scientists are linking large insurance databases that cover up to 50 million people with vaccination registries around the country for real-time checks of whether people see a doctor in the weeks after a flu shot and why. The huge numbers make it possible to quickly compare rates of complaints among the vaccinated and unvaccinated, said the project leader, Dr. Richard Platt, Harvard's population medicine chief.

_Johns Hopkins University will direct e-mails to at least 100,000 vaccine recipients to track how they're feeling, including the smaller complaints that wouldn't prompt a doctor visit. If anything seems connected, researchers can call to follow up with detailed questions.

_The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is preparing take-home cards that tell vaccine recipients how to report any suspected side effects to the nation's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting system.

""We don't have any reason to expect any unusual problems with this vaccine,"" said Dr. Neal Halsey, director of Hopkins' Institute for Vaccine Safety, who is directing the e-mail surveillance.

After all, the new H1N1 vaccine is a mere recipe change from the regular winter flu shot that's been used for decades in hundreds of millions of people without serious problems. Nor have there been any red flags in the few thousand people given test doses in studies to determine the right H1N1 dose. They've gotten the same sore arms and occasional headache or fever that's par for a winter flu shot.

But because this H1N1 flu targets the young more than the old, this may be the year that unprecedented numbers of children and pregnant women are vaccinated.

Then there's the glare of the Internet — where someone merely declaring on Facebook that he's sure the shot did harm could cause a wave of similar reports. Health authorities will have to tell quickly if there really do seem to be more cases of a particular health problem than usual.

So the CDC is racing to compile a list of what's normal: 25,000 heart attacks every week; 14,000 to 19,000 miscarriages every week; 300 severe allergic reactions called anaphylaxis every week.

Any spike would mean fast checking to see if the vaccine really seems to increase risk and by how much, so health officials could issue appropriate warnings.

Very rare side effects by definition could come to light only after large-scale inoculations begin — making this the year scientists may finally learn if flu vaccine truly is linked to Guillain-Barre, an often reversible but sometimes fatal paralysis. It's believed to strike between 1 and 2 of every 100,000 people. It often occurs right after another infection, such as food poisoning or even influenza.

But the vaccine concern stems from 1976, when 500 cases were reported among the 45 million people vaccinated against that year's swine flu. Scientists never could prove if the vaccine really caused the extra risk. The CDC maintains that if the regular winter flu vaccine is related, the risk is no more than a single case per million vaccinated.

So the question becomes, Is the risk of disease greater than that?

Mayo's Poland cites a study in Chicago that found the rate of preschoolers being hospitalized for the new H1N1 flu last spring was 2 1/2 times higher than that possible Guillain-Barre risk.

However the flu season turns out, the extra vaccine tracking promises a lasting impact.

""Part of what we hope is that it will teach us something about how to monitor the safety of all medical products quickly,"" said Harvard's Platt.",https://www.foxnews.com/story/government-to-intensely-track-for-h1n1-shot-side-effects
Fox News,Obama Elected,FOX News Exit Poll Summary,"The nation’s electorate was focused on the economy and change – two of Democrat Barack Obama’s biggest strengths – and that was more than enough to bring him victory over Republican John McCain.

Few items could illustrate more about this election than this: 75 percent of voters said the country is headed in the wrong direction, up from 46 percent in 2004 and 31 percent in 2000. And these voters went solidly for Obama — 62 percent to 36 percent for McCain.

Those voters saying the country is “on the right track” – 21 percent of voters – broke for McCain 71 percent to 28 percent. As expected, the economy overwhelmed all other issues, as 63 percent of voters said it was the most important issue facing the country. In addition, 50 percent said they are “very” worried about the economy’s direction and 48 percent are “very” worried the economic crisis will harm their family’s finances in the next year.

How voters felt about the economy mattered tremendously to their vote. Economy voters – those who said it is the top issue – backed Obama 53-44 percent. In addition, Obama won those very worried about the economy’s direction by 60-38 percent. Those who are not worried went for McCain 65-33 percent.

Candidate Qualities

More voters said they are looking for a candidate who can bring about change (34 percent) than any other quality and those voters overwhelmingly went for Obama 89-9 percent.

Nearly as many voters were looking for someone who shares their values (30 percent). These values voters broke for McCain 66 percent to 31 percent for Obama. McCain wins big among the one in five voters (20 percent) who said having the right experience was most important — 93-7.

A 57 percent majority said Obama is in touch with people like them – that’s nearly 20 points higher than the 39 percent who said McCain is.

Young Voters

So much attention has been paid to young voters during this election and they were a big part of Obama’s campaign – did they make up more of the electorate today than in the past? Not really – people under age 30 were 18 percent of all voters, up from 17 percent in the past three presidential elections and down from 21 percent in 1992. These young voters went heavily for Obama 66-32 percent.

By 68 percent to 31 percent Obama also won among the 11 percent of “new” voters who are participating in a presidential election for the first time this year. First-time voters made up 11 percent of voters in 2004 and went for John Kerry (53 percent) over George W. Bush (46 percent).

Additional Demographic Groups

Seniors went for McCain by 53-45 percent, which is about the same margin Bush won them by in 2004 (52-47 percent).

The number of Democrats outnumbered Republicans, and the number of Democrats increased slightly – 39 percent today up from 37 percent in 2004. While fewer Republicans represented – 32 percent, down from 37 percent last time.

Party loyalty was strong on both sides, as Obama was able to capture 89 percent of Democrats and McCain took 89 percent of Republicans.

Independents – 29 percent of the electorate – backed Obama 52 percent to 44 percent.

Even though most of those who backed Bush in 2004 supported McCain today (82 percent), some 18 percent defected from the Republican Party and voted for Obama this time.

Obama won women by 13 percentage points — 56-43. Gore won women by 11 points and Kerry won them by 3 points. White women broke for McCain 53-46 percent. In 2000, white women backed Bush by a razor-thin 1 point margin and by 11-points in 2004.

Men supported Obama by 49-48 percent. Bush won men by 11 points in both 2000 and 2004. And while McCain was favored among white men by 16 points, that is a narrower margin than Bush’s 25-point win among this group in 2004.

White Catholics went for McCain 52-47 percent, marking the first time this swing voting bloc has failed to back the winner in at least four elections.

In this historic election of the nation’s first African American president, black voters made up 13 percent of the electorate – up from 11 percent in 2004 and 10 percent in 2000. Fully 95 percent of blacks voted for Obama. In 2004, Kerry won 88 percent of the black vote and Gore won 90 percent in 2000.

Overall, white voters supported McCain by a 12 point margin — 55 percent to Obama’s 43 percent. In 2004, Bush won whites by 17 points. Hispanics favored Obama by 66-31 percent.

Vice Presidential Candidates

Two-thirds of voters (66 percent) said Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden is qualified to step in as president if it were to become necessary – nearly 30 points higher than the number who say the same of Republican Sarah Palin.

Below is a summary of several key battleground states.

Colorado

Colorado, with its 9 electoral votes, went for the Democratic presidential candidate tonight. Part of the reason for the change from red to blue was the impressive get out the vote efforts by the Obama campaign.

Iowa

Iowa is a swing state that went for Gore in 2000 and Bush in 2004. Now, in 2008 it is officially in the blue column backing Obama over McCain.

This year more voters identified themselves as Democrats and independents and fewer identified themselves as Republicans, compared to 2004.

Today, Democrats made up 34 percent of voters, independents 33 percent and Republicans 33 percent of voters. In 2004, Democrats made up 34 percent of voters, independents 30 percent, and Republicans 36 percent.

Some 61percent of these economy voters went for Obama and 37 percent for McCain.

Finally, women made up 52 percent of the voters in Nevada, and 61 percent went for Obama, 37 percent for McCain. In 2004, Bush received support of 47 percent of women voters in Nevada.

New Mexico

While New Mexico went narrowly for Bush in 2004 and for Gore in 2000, today the Land of Enchantment went for Obama over McCain.

Hispanics, who made up 41 percent of voters today, went 69 percent for Obama and 30 percent for McCain. The popular New Mexico governor and former Democratic presidential candidate had endorsed Obama.

Both campaigns ran attack ads in the state critical of each others immigration policies. Obama’s Spanish language ads claimed McCain and the Republican Party had, “two faces” when it came to immigration reform.

The McCain campaign ran advertisements blaming Obama and his Democratic colleagues for the failure of comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.

The voters of New Mexico came away believing that both candidates made unfair attacks, though many more attributed it to McCain. Nearly half (49 percent) said Obama made unfair attacks, 71 percent said McCain did.

In the Senate race, former Governor Jeanne Shaheen (D) beat incumbent Republican Senator John Sununu (R).

A key group to this victory was independents who were 44 percent of all voters. They broke 55 percent for Shaheen to 41 percent for Sununu.

It was not a pleasant campaign. Fully 65 percent of voters said Shaheen attacked Sununu unfairly. The same number thought Sununu made unfair attacks on Shaheen.

Pennsylvania

The Democrats kept Pennsylvania in their column thanks in large part to union voters who made up slightly more than one-quarter of the voters broke strongly for Obama, 62 percent to 37 percent for McCain.

Three-in-ten voters live in a union household. They gave Obama 57 percent to McCain’s 42 percent.

Voters without a college degree made up 61 percent of the electorate. They broke for Obama, giving him 53 percent of their votes to 45 percent for McCain.

Both campaigns made a tremendous effort in Ohio but more voters said they were contacted by the Obama campaign than the McCain. Forty-three percent said they were personally contacted by the Obama campaign, 36 percent by the McCain campaign.

Virginia

Tonight in Virginia, Obama led the Democratic Party to its first victory in the presidential race since 1964 with the election of Lyndon Johnson. Many groups helped push Obama to victory. New Voters made up 13 percent of the Obama’s winning coalition, and new voters went for Obama 63 percent to just 35 percent for McCain.

The Obama campaign targeted Virginia hard with its voter registration efforts and young voters were a significant part of that targeting.

Obama did, however, cut into Republican support in the suburbs and win those Virginia voters. Suburban voters went 51 percent to 48 percent in Virginia. In 2004, Bush carried suburban Virginia voters by 53 percent.

McCain carried Virginia’s white voters. They went 39 percent for Obama, 60 percent for McCain. In 2004, whites in Virginia broke 32 percent for the Democrat and 68 percent for the Republican.

Methodology

Edison/Mitofsky conducted these exit polls for FOX News and interviewed 12,000 voters nationwide as they left randomly selected polling places around the country.

In states where there is significant absentee and early voting, data from telephone polling is combined with the exit poll results. There is a national phone survey of absentee and early voters which is combined with the national exit poll results.

There are 15 states where absentee/early voters will be interviewed and those results are combined with the state exit polls – those states are: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas. In three states – Colorado, Oregon and Washington State – voters were only interviewed by telephone because of the small percentage of Election Day voters in those states.

Absentee and early voters made up an estimated 22 percent of the total national vote in the 2004 presidential election, and absentee and early voters are anticipated to make up approximately 30 percent of the total national vote in the 2008 presidential election.",https://www.foxnews.com/story/fox-news-exit-poll-summary

prev Image 3 of 3

Two bombs exploded in the crowded streets near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday, killing at least three people and injuring more than 130 in a bloody scene of shattered glass and severed limbs that raised alarms that terrorists might have struck again in the U.S.

A White House official speaking on condition of anonymity because the investigation was still unfolding said the attack was being treated as an act of terrorism.

President Barack Obama vowed that those responsible will ""feel the full weight of justice.""

As many as two unexploded bombs were also found near the end of the 26.2-mile course as part of what appeared to be a well-coordinated attack, but they were safely disarmed, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation.

The fiery twin blasts took place about 10 seconds and about 100 yards apart, knocking spectators and at least one runner off their feet, shattering windows and sending dense plumes of smoke rising over the street and through the fluttering national flags lining the course. Blood stained the pavement, and huge shards were missing from window panes as high as three stories.

""They just started bringing people in with no limbs,"" said runner Tim Davey of Richmond, Va. He said he and his wife, Lisa, tried to keep their children's eyes shielded from the gruesome scene inside a medical tent that had been set up to care for fatigued runners, but ""they saw a lot.""

""They just kept filling up with more and more casualties,"" Lisa Davey said. ""Most everybody was conscious. They were very dazed.""

Authorities shed no light on a motive or who may have carried out the bombings, and police said they had no suspects in custody. Authorities in Washington said there was no immediate claim of responsibility. The FBI took charge of the investigation.

Police said three people were killed. Hospitals reported at least 134 injured, at least 15 of them critically. The victims' injuries included broken bones, shrapnel wounds and ruptured eardrums.

At Massachusetts General Hospital, Alisdair Conn, chief of emergency services, said: ""This is something I've never seen in my 25 years here ... this amount of carnage in the civilian population. This is what we expect from war.""

Some 23,000 runners took part in the race, one of the world's oldest and most prestigious marathons.

One of Boston's biggest annual events, the race winds up near Copley Square, not far from the landmark Prudential Center and the Boston Public Library. It is held on Patriots Day, which commemorates the first battles of the American Revolution, at Concord and Lexington in 1775.

Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis asked people to stay indoors or go back to their hotel rooms and avoid crowds as bomb squads methodically checked parcels and bags left along the race route. He said investigators didn't know whether the bombs were hidden in mailboxes or trash cans.

He said authorities had received ""no specific intelligence that anything was going to happen"" at the race.

The Federal Aviation Administration barred low-flying aircraft within 3.5 miles of the site.

""We still don't know who did this or why,"" Obama said at the White House, adding, ""Make no mistake: We will get to the bottom of this.""

With scant official information to guide them, members of Congress said there was little or no doubt it was an act of terrorism.

""We just don't know whether it's foreign or domestic,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security.

A few miles away from the finish line and around the same time, a fire broke out at the John F. Kennedy Library. The police commissioner said that it may have been caused by an incendiary device and that it was not clear whether it was related to the bombings.

The first explosion occurred on the north side of Boylston Street, just before the finish line.

When the second bomb went off, the spectators' cheers turned to screams. As sirens blared, emergency workers and National Guardsmen who had been assigned to the race for crowd control began climbing over and tearing down temporary fences to get to the blast site.

The bombings occurred about four hours into the race and two hours after the men's winner crossed the line. By that point, more than 17,000 of the athletes had finished the race, but thousands more were still running.

The attack may have been timed for maximum carnage: The four-hour mark is typically a crowded time near the finish line because of the slow-but-steady recreational runners completing the race and because of all the friends and relatives clustered around to cheer them on.

Runners in the medical tent for treatment of dehydration or other race-related ills were pushed out to make room for victims of the bombing.

A woman who was a few feet from the second bomb, Brighid Wall, 35, of Duxbury, said that when it exploded, runners and spectators froze, unsure of what to do. Her husband threw their children to the ground, lay on top of them and another man lay on top of them and said, ""Don't get up, don't get up.""

After a minute or so without another explosion, Wall said, she and her family headed to a Starbucks and out the back door through an alley. Around them, the windows of the bars and restaurants were blown out.

She said she saw six to eight people bleeding profusely, including one man who was kneeling, dazed, with blood trickling down his head. Another person was on the ground covered in blood and not moving.

""My ears are zinging. Their ears are zinging,"" Wall said. ""It was so forceful. It knocked us to the ground.""

Competitors and race volunteers were crying as they fled the chaos. Authorities went onto the course to carry away the injured, while race stragglers were rerouted away from the smoking site.

Roupen Bastajian, a state trooper from Smithfield, R.I., had just finished the race when he heard the blasts.

""I started running toward the blast. And there were people all over the floor,"" he said. ""We started grabbing tourniquets and started tying legs. A lot of people amputated. ... At least 25 to 30 people have at least one leg missing, or an ankle missing, or two legs missing.""

The race honored the victims of the Newtown, Conn., shooting with a special mile marker in Monday's race.

Boston Athletic Association president Joanne Flaminio previously said there was ""special significance"" to the fact that the race is 26.2 miles long and 26 people died at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Fox News,Japan Earthquake & Tsunamis,Hundreds of Bodies Found in Japan After Massive Tsunami Spawned by Earthquake,"Japanese police say 200 to 300 bodies have been found in a northeastern coastal area where a massive earthquake spawned a ferocious tsunami Friday that swept away boats, cars and homes.

The magnitude 8.9 offshore quake -- the largest in Japan's history -- unleashed a 23-foot tsunami and was followed by more than 50 aftershocks for hours, many of them of more than magnitude 6.0.

The bodies found were in Sendai city, the closest major city to the epicenter, Japanese police said. Officials said another 110 were confirmed dead, with 350 people missing. Police also said 544 people were injured. The death toll was likely to continue climbing given the scale of Friday's disaster.

Tsunami waves generated by the massive quake hit as far as Hawaii, Alaska and the Oregon coast Friday morning. The first waves crashed into the Hawaii island of Kauai at 3:13 a.m. local time. Officials predicted they would experience waves up to 6 feet.

Alaska Emergency Management also reported a 5.1-foot wave at Shemya, 1.5-foot at Adak, and 1.6-foot at Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands. Shemya is 1,200 miles southwest of Anchorage.

Emergency Management Specialist David Lee at Fort Richardson said there are no reports of damage and no significant damage expected on the coast of Alaska, although that could still depend on the surge in different areas.

The Alaska Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning for the coastal areas of Alaska from Attu to Amchitka Pass in the Aleutians and an advisory from Amchitka Pass along the West Coast to Oregon.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the 2:46 p.m. quake was a magnitude 8.9, the biggest earthquake to hit Japan since officials began keeping records in the late 1800s, and one of the biggest ever recorded in the world.

The quake struck at a depth of six miles, about 80 miles off the eastern coast, the agency said. The area is 240 miles northeast of Tokyo.

The Japanese government ordered thousands of residents near a nuclear power plant in Onahama city to evacuate because the plant's system was unable to cool the reactor. The reactor was not leaking radiation but its core remained hot even after a shutdown. The plant is 170 miles northeast of Tokyo.

Dozens of cities and villages along a 1,300-mile stretch of coastline were shaken by violent tremors that reached as far away as Tokyo, hundreds of miles from the epicenter.

""The earthquake has caused major damage in broad areas in northern Japan,"" Prime Minister Naoto Kan said at a news conference.

A passenger train with an unknown number of people aboard was unaccounted for Friday, Kyodo News reported. The East Japan Railway Co. train was running near Nobiru Station on the Senseki Line connecting Sendai to Ishinomaki when a massive quake hit, triggering a 33-foot tsunami, according to the station.

A Japanese coast guard official said a search is also under way for a ship carrying 80 dock workers that was swept away when a tsunami struck the northeastern coast. The vessel was washed away from a shipbuilding site in Miyagi prefecture (state). That's the area most affected by a massive offshore earthquake on Friday. The quake triggered the tsunami.

Trouble was also reported at two other nuclear plants as well, but there was no radiation leak at any.

Even for a country used to earthquakes, this one was of horrific proportions because of the tsunami that crashed ashore, swallowing everything in its path as it surged several miles inland before retreating. The apocalyptic images of surging water broadcast by Japanese TV networks resembled scenes from a Hollywood disaster movie.

Large fishing boats and other sea vessels rode high waves into the cities, slamming against overpasses or scraping under them and snapping power lines along the way. Upturned and partially submerged vehicles were seen bobbing in the water. Ships anchored in ports crashed against each other.

The highways to the worst-hit coastal areas were severely damaged and communications, including telephone lines, were snapped. Train services in northeastern Japan and in Tokyo, which normally serve 10 million people a day, were also suspended, leaving untold numbers stranded in stations or roaming the streets. Tokyo's Narita airport was closed indefinitely.

Waves of muddy waters flowed over farmland near the city of Sendai, carrying buildings, some on fire, inland as cars attempted to drive away. Sendai airport, north of Tokyo, was inundated with cars, trucks, buses and thick mud deposited over its runways. Fires spread through a section of the city, public broadcaster NHK reported.

More than 300 houses were washed away in Ofunato City alone. Television footage showed mangled debris, uprooted trees, upturned cars and shattered timber littering streets.

The tsunami roared over embankments, washing anything in its path inland before reversing directions and carrying the cars, homes and other debris out to sea. Flames shot from some of the houses, probably because of burst gas pipes.

""Our initial assessment indicates that there has already been enormous damage,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said. ""We will make maximum relief effort based on that assessment.""

He said the Defense Ministry was sending troops to the quake-hit region. A utility aircraft and several helicopters were on the way.

A large fire erupted at the Cosmo oil refinery in Ichihara city in Chiba prefecture and burned out of control with 100-foot-high flames whipping into the sky.

From northeastern Japan's Miyagi prefecture, NHK showed footage of a large ship being swept away and ramming directly into a breakwater in Kesennuma city.

NHK said more than 4 million buildings were without power in Tokyo and its suburbs.

Also in Miyagi, a fire broke out in a turbine building of a nuclear power plant, but it was later extinguished, said Tohoku Electric Power Co. the company said.

A reactor area of a nearby plant was leaking water, the company said. But it was unclear if the leak was caused by tsunami water or something else. There were no reports of radioactive leaks at any of Japan's nuclear plants.

Jefferies International Limited, a global investment banking group, said it estimated overall losses to be about $10 billion.

A tsunami warning was extended to a number of Pacific, Southeast Asian and Latin American nations, including Japan, Russia, Indonesia, New Zealand and Chile. In the Philippines, authorities ordered an evacuation of coastal communities, but no unusual waves were reported.

Thousands of people fled their homes in Indonesia after officials warned of a tsunami up to 6 feet high. But waves of only 4 inches were measured. No big waves came to the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory, either.

In downtown Tokyo, large buildings shook violently and workers poured into the street for safety. TV footage showed a large building on fire and bellowing smoke in the Odaiba district of Tokyo. The tremor bent the upper tip of the iconic Tokyo Tower, a 1,093-foot steel structure inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

Footage on NHK from their Sendai office showed employees stumbling around and books and papers crashing from desks. It also showed a glass shelter at a bus stop in Tokyo completely smashed by the quake and a weeping woman nearby being comforted by another woman.

Several quakes had hit the same region in recent days, including a 7.3 magnitude one on Wednesday that caused no damage.

Hiroshi Sato, a disaster management official in northern Iwate prefecture, said officials were having trouble getting an overall picture of the destruction.

""We don't even know the extent of damage. Roads were badly damaged and cut off as tsunami washed away debris, cars and many other things,"" he said.

Dozens of fires were reported in northern prefectures of Fukushima, Sendai, Iwate and Ibaraki. Collapsed homes and landslides were also reported in Miyagi.

Japan's worst previous quake was in 1923 in Kanto, an 8.3-magnitude temblor that killed 143,000 people, according to USGS. A 7.2-magnitude quake in Kobe city in 1996 killed 6,400 people.

Japan lies on the ""Ring of Fire"" -- an arc of earthquake and volcanic zones stretching around the Pacific where about 90 percent of the world's quakes occur, including the one that triggered the Dec. 26, 2004, Indian Ocean tsunami that killed an estimated 230,000 people in 12 nations. A magnitude-8.8 temblor that shook central Chile last February also generated a tsunami and killed 524 people.

Fox News,London Olympics ,London 2012 Closing Ceremony: Rio de Janeiro Takes Torch as Britain Closes With Rock & Roll Extravaganza,"See you in Brazil!

The 2012 Olympic Games came to a close as London’s mayor, Boris Johnson, passed on the Olympic flag decorated with the four symbolic rings to Eduardo Paes, Rio de Janeiro’s mayor, who waved the over-sized flag with pride.

Following the Brazilian national anthem, the ceremony culminated in carnival fashion, as Brazilian samba dancers, Capoeira artists, singers and rappers welcomed the world to their home country for the 2016 Olympic Games kicking of Aug. 5.

Victoria’s Secret supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio and Brazil’s soccer legend Pelé, also took part of the festivities.

After a glorious two weeks of never-to-be-forgotten moments that left Britain exhausted, exhilarated and deeply proud, organizers handed the baton to 2016 host Brazil, which must now take up the Herculean task of matching them.

Judging by the swaying samba of Marisa Monte and the sexy baritone of Seu Jorge in Brazil's eight-minute musical and visual postcard for the 2016 games, they look to be off to a foot-stomping start.

Aside from Brazil’s lavish presentation, the hugely entertaining closing ceremony for the Olympics included a sensational rock 'n roll nostalgia tour that thrilled the London night with top-of-the-chart classics, supermodels and psychedelic mayhem.

The three-hour extravaganza offered a sensory blast including rock 'n' roll rickshaws, dustbin percussionists, an exploding yellow car and a marching band in red tunics and bearskin hats.

The Spice Girls staged a show-stopping reunion, and Monty Python's Eric Idle sauntered through ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"" — accompanied by Roman centurions, Scottish bagpipers and a human cannonball.

It all made for a madcap mashup that had 80,000 fans at Olympic Stadium stomping, cheering and singing along. Organizers estimated 300 million or more were watching around the world.

What a way to end a games far more successful than many Londoners expected. Early security glitches were conquered with the help of the military, road traffic was manageable and the wettest early summer on record gave way to mostly sunny skies. More importantly, British athletes overachieved.

It all came with a price tag of $14 billion — three times the original estimate. But nobody wanted to spoil the fun with such mundane concerns, at least not on this night.

""We lit the flame, and we lit up the world,"" said London organizing committee chief Sebastian Coe. ""When our time came, Britain, we did it right.""

International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge declared the Olympics over with praise for the athletes.

""Through your commitment to fair play, your respect for opponents, and your grace in defeat as well as in victory, you have earned the right to be called Olympians,"" he said, adding: ""These were happy and glorious games.""

But the night was about splash more than speeches.

Festive and fast-moving, the ceremony opened with pop bands Madness, Pet Shop Boys and One Direction, a shout-out to Winston Churchill and a tribute to the Union Jack — the Olympic Stadium floor arranged to resemble the British flag.

Monochrome recreations of London landmarks were covered in newsprint, from Big Ben's clock tower and Tower Bridge to the London Eye ferris wheel and the chubby high-rise known as the Gherkin.

Street percussion group Stomp built the noise into a frenzy, and dancers brandished brooms, in a nod to the spontaneous popular movement to clean up London after riots shook neighborhoods not far from Olympic Stadium just a year ago.

Liam Gallagher performed ""Wonderwall,"" a 1990s hit by his former band, Oasis, Muse rocked the house with the hard-edged Olympic anthem ""Survival,"" and Queen guitarist Brian May was joined by singer Jessie J for a crowd-pleasing ""We Will Rock You.""

The headline performers were each paid a pound, a little more than $1.50.

The night ended with the extinguishing of the multi-petaled Olympic cauldron and a supercharged rendition of ""My Generation"" and other classics by The Who that had the crowd dancing in the aisles. Confetti rained down, and fireworks lit up the sky.

Prince William's wife, Kate, and Prince Harry took seats next to Rogge. They sang along to ""God Save the Queen."" There was no sign of the queen herself, who made a memorable mock parachute entrance at the July 27 opening ceremony.

Following Olympic tradition, the 10,800 athletes of the London Games marched in as one rather than with their nations, symbolizing the harmony and friendship inspired by the games.

As the crowd cheered their heroes and flashbulbs rippled through the stadium, the Olympians cheered back, some carrying national flags, others snapping photographs with smartphones and cameras.

They held hands, embraced and carried each other on their shoulders, finally forming a human mosh pit on the field.

The ceremony had something for everyone, from tween girls to 1960s hippies. The face of John Lennon appeared on the stadium floor, assembled by 101 fragments of sculpture, and just as quickly gave way to George Michael, Fatboy Slim and Annie Lennox.

Britons, who had fretted for weeks that the games would become a fiasco, were buoyed by their biggest medal haul since 1908 — 29 golds and 65 medals in all.

The United States edged China in both the gold medal and total medal standings, eclipsing its best performance at an Olympics on foreign soil after the Dream Team narrowly held off Spain in basketball for the country's 46th gold.

While the games may have lacked some of the grandeur of the Beijing Olympics in 2008, there were more than a few unforgettable moments.

Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt became an Olympic legend by repeating as champion in both the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints. Michael Phelps ended his long career as the most decorated Olympian in history.

British distance runner Mo Farah became a national treasure by sweeping the 5,000- and 10,000-meter races, and favorite daughter Jessica Ennis became a global phenomenon with her victory in the heptathlon.

Female athletes took center stage in a way they never had before. American gymnast Gabby Douglas soared to gold and the U.S. soccer team made a dramatic march to the championship. Packed houses turned out to watch the new event of women's boxing. And women competed for Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Brunei for the first time.

And then there was Oscar Pistorius, the double-amputee from South Africa running on carbon-fiber blades, who didn't win a medal but nonetheless left a champion. And sprinter Manteo Mitchell, who completed his leg of the 4x400 relay semifinal on a broken leg, allowing his team to qualify and win silver.

Britons seemed exhausted and exhilarated after two glorious weeks in the world's spotlight, just months after the country celebrated the queen's 60th year on the throne with a magnificent pageant and street parties.

Some at Olympic Park acknowledged happy surprise that not much had gone wrong, and so much had gone right.

""I was a bit worried we wouldn't be able to live up to it,"" said Phil Akrill of Chichester. ""But walking around here it's just unbelievable.""

Even non-Brits were proud of their adopted homeland.

""It's just been a really nice thing to see,"" said Anja Ekelof, a Swede who now lives in Scotland. ""The whole country has come together.""

Now that Brazil is set to host the 2016 games many are bracing for a rocky ride as Rio — a laid-back beach city not known for its efficiency or punctuality — rushes to build four main Olympic sites and undertake a massive infrastructure overhaul.

Rio native Joao Carlos de Figueireiro said that despite the ""mess"" that was sure to come, he had faith things would work out in the end.

""There are definitely things we need to work on, organization-wise,"" said Figueireiro, a 56-year-old barman at a neighborhood cafe. ""But we're experts at pulling rabbits out of hats at the last minute and I'm sure that's what we're going to do.""

Fox News,Russia Invades Ukraine,Ukraine official: Russia has launched 'armed invasion' in Crimea,"Russian troops moved into Crimea Friday, U.S. officials told Fox News, prompting Ukraine to accuse Russia of an ""armed invasion.""

At the White House, President Obama said the U.S. government is ""deeply concerned"" by reports of Russian ""military movements"" and warned any violation of Ukraine's sovereignty would be ""deeply destabilizing.""

""There will be costs"" for any military intervention, he said, without specifying what those costs might be.

U.S. officials told Fox News they see “evidence of air and maritime movement into and out of Crimea by Russian forces” although the Pentagon declined to officially ""characterize"" the movement.

Agence France Press quoted a top Ukranian official as saying Russian aircraft carrying nearly 2,000 suspected troops have landed at a military air base near the regional capital of the restive Crimean peninsula.

""Thirteen Russian aircraft landed at the airport of Gvardeyskoye (near Simferopol) with 150 people in each one,"" Sergiy Kunitsyn, the Ukrainian president's special representative in Crimea, told the local ATR television channel, according to AFP. He accused Russia of an ""armed invasion.""

The new developments prompted Ukraine to accuse Russia of a ""military invasion and occupation"" -- a claim that brought an alarming new dimension to the crisis.

Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a statement late Friday saying, ""It appears that the Russian military now controls the Crimean peninsula. This aggression is a threat not only to Ukraine, but to regional peace and stability. Russia’s latest action is yet another indicator that Vladimir Putin’s hegemonic ambitions threaten U.S. interests and allies around the world.""

Russia kept silent on claims of military intervention, even as it maintained its hard-line stance on protecting ethnic Russians in Crimea, a peninsula of Ukraine on the northern coast of the Black Sea.

A spokesman for the Ukrainian border service said eight Russian transport planes have landed in Crimea with unknown cargo.

Serhiy Astakhov told The Associated Press that the Il-76 planes arrived unexpectedly Friday and were given permission to land, one after the other, at Gvardeiskoye air base, north of the regional capital, Simferopol.

Astakhov said the people in the planes refused to identify themselves and waved off customs officials, saying they didn't require their services.

Earlier in the day, Russian armored vehicles rumbled across Crimea and reports surfaced of troops being deployed at airports and a coast guard base – signs of a more heavy-handed approach to the crisis from Moscow.

Ukraine's U.N. ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev told the U.N. Security Council that Russian military helicopters and transport planes are entering his country, that neither major airport in Ukraine is under national control and that the main airport was ""captured by Russian armed forces.""

He claimed 11 Russian military helicopters had been brought in along with M-24 military transport planes.

Armed gunmen took control of the two main airports in Crimea Friday. However, Russia has so far been silent on the claims of military involvement. No violence was reported at the civilian airport in Crimea's capital of Simferopol or at the military airport in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, also part of Crimea. At the Simferopol airport, a man claiming to speak for the camouflage-clad forces patrolling the airport described them as Crimean militiamen.

Meanwhile, ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych surfaced in Russia Friday, thundering defiantly against the “pro-fascist hooligans” who drove him from office.

Yanukovych warned of the dangers of “irresponsible Western policy” as he vowed to continue the fight for Ukraine’s future Friday at a press conference in Rostov-on-don, Russia—his first public appearance since last Saturday.

""I intend to keep fighting for the future of Ukraine against those who are using fear and terror to seize the country,"" he told reporters.

The fugitive leader said he was forced to leave Ukraine due to threats, Reuters reported. He blamed the country’s crisis on “irresponsible Western policy,” and said he trusted the ""decency of Western mediators” when he signed a peace deal last week brokered by members of the European Union. But recent actions by the opposition run counter to the agreement, he said.

Yanukovych said he does not plan to ask Russia for military support in dealing with the crisis in Ukraine, where he said power was stolen by ``a bunch of radicals.”

""Fascist hooligans"" have taken power in Ukraine, Yanukovych told reporters, according to the BBC.

Fox News,Trump Inauguration,FACT CHECK: Trump overstates crowd size at inaugural,"next Image 1 of 3

prev next Image 2 of 3

prev Image 3 of 3

President Donald Trump's speech Saturday at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency turned into the latest battle in, as he put it, his ""running war with the media."" He had two central complaints: that the media misrepresented the size of the crowd at his inauguration and that it was incorrectly reported a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. was removed from the Oval Office. A look at those assertions:

TRUMP: ""I made a speech. I looked out. The field was — it looked like a million, a million and a half people.""

The president went on to say that one network ""said we drew 250,000 people. Now that's not bad. But it's a lie."" He then claimed that were 250,000 right by the stage and the ""rest of the, you know, 20-block area, all the way back to the Washington Monument was packed.""

""So we caught them,"" said Trump. ""And we caught them in a beauty. And I think they're going to pay a big price.""

THE FACTS: Trump is wrong. Photos of the National Mall from his inauguration make clear that the crowd did not extend to the Washington Monument. Large swaths of empty space are visible on the Mall.

Thin crowds and partially empty bleachers also dotted the inaugural parade route. Hotels across the District of Columbia reported vacancies, a rarity for an event as large as a presidential inauguration.

And ridership on the Washington's Metro system didn't match that of recent inaugurations. As of 11 a.m. that day, there were 193,000 trips taken, according to the transit service's Twitter account. At the same hour eight years ago, there had been 513,000 trips. Four years later, there were 317,000 for Obama's second inauguration.

There were 197,000 at 11 a.m. in 2005 for President George W. Bush's second inauguration. The Metro system also posted that only two parking lots at stations were more than 60 percent full.

But the exact size of the crowd may never be known since the National Park Service, which used to provide those estimates, stopped doing it in the 1990s.

___

TRUMP: The president also went after a reporter who incorrectly wrote that the president had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. The reporter later acknowledged the error, saying a Secret Service agent and a door had obstructed his view of the bust when reporters were allowed into the room briefly after Trump's swearing in.

""But this is how dishonest the media is,"" Trump said.

""Now, big story, the retraction was like, where?"" he asked. ""Was it a line or do they even bother running it?""

THE FACTS: Trump is right. The reporter for Time magazine made an error. The White House said Trump never removed the King bust from the Oval Office.

The error about the bust was first transmitted in a pool report distributed among reporters. The White House often uses a pool system when not all reporters who want to attend an event can be accommodated in a space.

At 7:30 p.m., reporter Zeke Miller wrote a pool report saying, ""The MLK bust was no longer on display.""

Once Miller realized his error, an update was sent to the pool. ""The MLK bust remains in the Oval Office, in addition to the Churchill bust, per a WH aide. It was apparently obscured by a door and an agent during the spray. Your pool offers sincerest apologies.""

Miller also corrected the error on Twitter, and Time magazine corrected its story based on his report.

""Correction: An earlier version of the story said that a bust of Martin Luther King had been moved. It is still in the Oval Office,"" it reads.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/fact-check-trump-overstates-crowd-size-at-inaugural
Fox News,Gay Marriage ,Gay marriage: Why Supreme Court got it wrong,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

One does not have to be a homophobe or bigot to believe that the Supreme Court made a tragic error today in creating out of thin air an imaginary right for gay marriage. Friday’s landmark mistake will have legal, sociological, and spiritual consequences for years to come.

First, consider the legal ramifications of Friday’s decision. By enshrining gay marriage as a “civil right,” the Court will be opening a floodgate of litigation against individuals and businesses that refuse to honor same-sex marriages because of religious convictions. After all, if gay marriage is a civil right, then anyone who opposes it is guilty of a civil rights violation. We have already seen bakeries, florists, and wedding chapels sued and, in some cases, put out of business because of their refusal to participate in gay wedding ceremonies. Expect these suits to accelerate exponentially now that progressives have been emboldened and armed with a Supreme Court decision.

Additionally, we can expect both civil and governmental actions against religious institutions that refuse to honor gay marriage as a civil right. During the oral arguments for this case on April 28, Justice Samuel Alito asked the Solicitor General for the Obama administration, Donald Verrilli, if the a decision expanding the definition of marriage would require religious colleges to offer housing to same-sex couples or risk losing their tax-exempt status. Verrilli responded repeatedly, “I don’t deny this is going to be an issue.”

It’s going to be an issue not only for religious colleges but also for churches that refuse to honor same-sex marriage. I am repeatedly confronted by the straw man argument that “No one is going to hold a gun to pastors’ heads and force them to perform same-sex marriages.”

Friday’s Supreme Court decision represents a collective shaking of our fists in God’s face saying, “We don’t care what You say about life’s most important relationship. We know best.”

No one is predicting that will happen, but I believe that ultimately churches that refuse to honor same-sex marriage may face government sanctions—including the loss of their tax-exempt status—for refusing to honor same-sex unions.

Again, Justice Alito pointed out in the oral arguments that in 1983 the Supreme Court upheld the revocation of the tax-exempt status of a religious organization—Bob Jones University—for prohibiting interracial marriage. If gay marriage has now been elevated to a civil right on par with interracial marriage, what rationale would government have for not revoking the tax-exempt status of any religious organization that does not recognize same-sex unions?

We don’t have to guess about the sociological implications of Friday’s decision. Stanley Kurtz, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, contends that the legitimization of same-sex unions in Scandinavian countries has caused the heterosexual marriage rate to drop dramatically, while the number of children born out of wedlock has risen, resulting in numerous societal problems.

The reason for the drop in the heterosexual marriage rate is clear: if marriage can be redefined to include any and every relationship, then why bother to marry at all? Anytime you counterfeit something, you cheapen the value of the real thing, and gay marriage is “counterfeit marriage” (In fairness, heterosexuals have also been cheapening the value of marriage for years through adultery and divorce.)

As a Christian, I am most concerned about the spiritual implications of Friday’s decision. During the oral arguments for this case on April 28, Justice Kennedy noted that the traditional definition of marriage “has been with us for millennia. It’s very difficult for the Court to say, ‘Oh, well, we know better.’”

Friday, the Supreme Court said in essence, “We know better than God how to define marriage.” For thousands of years both Christians and Jews have believed in both the Old and New Testament definition of marriage that was written by Moses and affirmed by Jesus Himself when He said that God “made them male and female ... For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh” (Matthew 19:4-5).



Jesus taught that sex was a gift from God between one man and one woman in a marriage relationship. Any variation from that—premarital sex, adultery, polygamy, unbiblical divorce, or homosexuality—is a deviation from God’s original plan for sex. Friday’s Supreme Court decision represents a collective shaking of our fists in God’s face saying , “We don’t care what You say about life’s most important relationship. We know best.”

While Friday’s decision by the Supreme Court is tragic, it is ultimately irrelevant. Regardless of what the Supreme Court justices declared Friday, the Judge of all of the universe has already issued His decision: marriage should be reserved for one man and one woman. And there is no appealing that verdict.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gay-marriage-why-supreme-court-got-it-wrong
Fox News,Trump Elected,"Trump wins presidency, defeats Clinton in historic election upset","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Donald Trump, defying the pundits and polls to the end, defeated Hillary Clinton in Tuesday’s presidential election and claimed an establishment-stunning victory that exposes the depth of voter dissatisfaction – and signals immense changes ahead for American policy at home and abroad.

Seventeen months after the billionaire tycoon’s Trump Tower entrance into the race, the first-time candidate once dismissed by the political elite will become the 45th president, Fox News projects.

Speaking to cheering supporters early Wednesday morning at his victory party in New York City, the Republican candidate and now president-elect said Clinton called to congratulate him, and Fox News confirms she has conceded. Despite their hard-fought campaign, Trump praised Clinton for her service and said “it is time for us to come together as one united people.”

“I will be president for all Americans,” Trump vowed, after a brief introduction by running mate Mike Pence.

TRUMP'S AGENDA: WHAT HIS ELECTION MEANS FOR AMERICA

Sounding a call to “reclaim our country’s destiny,” Trump declared: “The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. … America will no longer settle for anything less than the best.”

Trump will be the oldest president in U.S. history, entering the Oval Office at age 70. With her defeat, Clinton falls short in her second bid to become the first female president of the United States.

Though Clinton called Trump, her campaign initially did not concede defeat. Earlier, her campaign chairman John Podesta addressed supporters nearby in New York and said several states were “too close to call.”

Clinton herself did not appear at the rally. Podesta had urged supporters to “head home” and said they would not have “anything more to say tonight.”

Amid Trump’s victory, Republicans also were projected to hold onto their majority in the House and Senate, improving Trump’s chances of advancing his agenda in office.

A surge of support in key battlegrounds – and especially surprise victories in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – helped propel Trump to victory. The GOP nominee built a commanding lead early on with wins in heavily contested North Carolina, Florida, Ohio and Iowa.

Clinton won her share of battlegrounds, including Virginia and Nevada and Colorado, but could not make up for Trump’s strong performance in other states thought to favor the Democrat.

The billionaire businessman’s victory marked a remarkable upset and turnaround, after he had been complaining amid a rough patch just weeks ago the vote could be “rigged” against him.

Clinton was still thought to have the clear advantage in the electoral map going into Tuesday’s vote, yet the polls had been tightening in the race’s closing days.

His victory could demonstrate just how much the dynamics were shifting in his favor – and perhaps how his true support was elusive all along to pollsters and others gauging the race.

Without question, his bid was helped over the last two weeks by a burst of setbacks for his opponent.

Eleven days before the election, FBI Director James Comey announced the bureau was revisiting the investigation into Clinton’s personal email server use while secretary of state, after discovering new messages on the laptop of disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide. He closed the case again on Sunday, but the political damage may have been done. And the WikiLeaks release of emails hacked from Podesta’s account became a constant distraction for the campaign, as the messages revealed infighting, internal concerns about the Clinton family’s foundation and even evidence that the now-head of the Democratic National Committee leaked town hall questions to Clinton during the primaries.

This at times overshadowed the numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Trump that came out in October (which he denies), following leaked footage from over a decade ago showing Trump making crude comments about women.

Trump’s victory marks the second time Clinton was thwarted in her bid to become the first female U.S. president, having been defeated by President Obama in their 2008 primary race.

But Trump has been able to defy expectations from the start. He defeated a deep field of 16 competitors during the Republican primaries – stitching together a motivated coalition of voters invigorated by his outsider, populist message; throwing his rivals off their talking points during a raucous marathon of debates; and commanding media attention throughout with his unpredictable, learn-as-he-goes campaign style.

He also defied party orthodoxy, railing against free-trade deals like NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership and staking out a sometimes-confusing set of positions on foreign policy that may yet evolve. Democrats have criticized him heavily for statements expressing admiration for Russia’s Vladimir Putin and a desire to rebuild ties with Moscow.

Trump was aided by the infrastructure of the GOP, but his campaign never came close to the juggernaut operation mounted by Clinton. While she entered the final stretch of the race with an army of high-powered surrogates, Trump’s campaign was driven mainly by him, an inner circle of family members and a rotating set of top campaign advisers. Surrogates like retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani advocated aggressively for the Republican nominee, but he remained at odds with many influential elected Republicans who in some cases – as with House Speaker Paul Ryan – endorsed him, but only reluctantly. His stances on trade as well as his hardline immigration proposals – including variations on a plan to suspend Muslim immigration from certain countries – also made party brass uncomfortable.

The late emergence of a 2005 tape showing him making crude comments about women led some congressional Republicans to abandon him entirely. But even the biggest controversies seemed only to ding Trump, whose resilience in the polls could be credited to a movement of grassroots supporters who seemed to have little interest in the nominee’s tensions with the GOP establishment and saw him as the true change-maker in the election.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-wins-presidency-defeats-clinton-in-historic-election-upset
Fox News,BP Oil Spill,BP Spill Response Plans Severely Flawed,"NEW ORLEANS — Glaring errors and omissions in BP's oil spill response plans have exposed a slapdash effort to follow environmental rules, outraging Gulf Coast residents who can see on their beaches how unprepared the company was.

BP PLC's 582-page regional spill plan for the Gulf, and its 52-page, site-specific plan for the Deepwater Horizon rig vastly understate the dangers posed by an uncontrolled leak and vastly overstate the company's preparedness to deal with one, according to an Associated Press analysis. The lengthy plans were approved by the federal government last year before BP drilled its ill-fated well.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was incensed Wednesday after reading the AP story and said BP has been reactive — not proactive — all along.

""Look, it's obvious to everybody in south Louisiana that they didn't have a plan, they didn't have an adequate plan to deal with this spill,"" Jindal said. ""They didn't anticipate the BOP (blowout preventer) failure. They didn't anticipate this much oil hitting our coast. From the very first days, they kept telling us, 'Don't worry, the oil's not going to make it to your coast.'""

Among the glaring errors in the report: A professor is listed in BP's 2009 response plan for a Gulf of Mexico oil spill as a national wildlife expert. He died in 2005.

More On This... Massive Oil Spill Washes Ashore in the Gulf

The plan lists cold-water marine mammals including walruses, sea otters, sea lions and seals as ""sensitive biological resources."" None of those animals live anywhere near the Gulf.

Also, names and phone numbers of several Texas A&M University marine life specialists are wrong. So are the numbers for marine mammal stranding network offices in Louisiana and Florida, which are disconnected.

""The AP report paints a picture of a company that was making it up as it went along, while telling regulators it had the full capability to deal with a major spill,"" Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., wrote in an e-mail to the AP. ""We know that wasn't true.""

Nelson said he and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., have asked for a criminal investigation into some of the company's claims.

Earlier this month, the federal government announced criminal and civil investigations into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Attorney General Eric Holder has not said who might be targeted in the probes into the largest oil spill in U.S. history.

Legal experts say that to file criminal charges, the Justice Department will have to find evidence that BP or other companies involved in the deadly oil rig explosion and subsequent spill orchestrated a coverup, destroyed key documents or lied to government agents. Charges and civil penalties can be brought under a variety of environmental protection laws.

In its Deepwater Horizon plan, the British oil giant stated: ""BP Exploration and Production Inc. has the capability to respond, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge, or a substantial threat of such a discharge, resulting from the activities proposed in our Exploration Plan.""

In the spill scenarios detailed in the documents, fish, marine mammals and birds escape serious harm; beaches remain pristine; water quality is only a temporary problem. And those are the projections for a leak about 10 times worse than what has been calculated for the ongoing disaster.

Rep. Darrell Issa of California, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform committee, is investigating failures by the federal Minerals Management Service, which regulates oil rigs. He said Wednesday that if there had been a serious effort to reform the agency, the ""mistakes"" in BP's report would have been caught.

""This is yet another example of MMS acting as a rubber stamp for industry, and industry settling for the lowest possible standard of safety at the expense the environment and economic vitality of the Gulf region,"" he said.

BP spokesman Daren Beaudo said the response plans will be reviewed ""so that we can determine what worked well and what needs improvement.""

""Thus far we have implemented the largest spill response in history and many, many elements of it have worked well. However, we are greatly disappointed that oil has made landfall and impacted shorelines and marshes. The situation we are dealing with is clearly complex, unprecedented and will offer us much to learn from,"" Beaudo said.

The plans contain wildly false assumptions about oil spills. BP's proposed method to calculate spill volume judging by the darkness of the oil sheen is way off. The internationally accepted formula would produce estimates 100 times higher.

The Gulf's loop current, which is projected to help eventually send oil hundreds of miles around Florida's southern tip and up the Atlantic coast, isn't mentioned in either plan.

The website listed for Marine Spill Response Corp. — one of two firms that BP relies on for equipment to clean a spill — links to a defunct Japanese-language page.

In early May, at least 80 Louisiana state prisoners were trained to clean birds by listening to a presentation and watching a video. It was a work force never envisioned in the plans, which contain no detailed references to how birds would be cleansed of oil.

And while BP officials and the federal government have insisted that they have attacked the problem as if it were a much larger spill, that isn't apparent from the constantly evolving nature of the response.

Asked if he was angry about the inadequate plans, Jindal said: ""Absolutely. Absolutely. You can't just assume the best. Your plan can't be, well, the BOP is going to work. Your plan can't be, well, the oil is not going to travel more than 50 miles and reach our coast. Your plan can't be that if the BOP doesn't work, then the junk shot is going to work, then the mud kill shot is going to work.""

This week, after BP reported the seemingly good news that a containment cap installed on the wellhead was funneling some of the gushing crude to a tanker on the surface, BP introduced a whole new set of plans mostly aimed at capturing more oil.

The latest incarnation calls for building a larger cap, using a special incinerator to burn off some of the recaptured oil and bringing in a floating platform to process the oil being sucked away from the gushing well.

In other words, the on-the-fly planning continues.

___

One of the most glaring errors in BP's plans involves Dr. Peter Lutz, a Florida professor, one of several dozen experts recommended as resources to be contacted in the event of a spill.

Lutz is listed as a go-to wildlife specialist at the University of Miami. But Lutz, an eminent sea turtle expert, left Miami almost 20 years ago to chair the marine biology department at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton. He died four years before the plan was published.

Molly Lutcavage, a research professor at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst who worked closely with Lutz on a groundbreaking report on the effects of oil on sea turtles, was dismayed to hear that Lutz was still listed in the response plan.

""It's horribly depressing and shocking that so little attention is paid to a bona fide contingency plan,"" she said. ""What would Peter think? Oh, boy. I think he would think it was typical of bureaucracy.""

There are other examples of how BP's plans have fallen short:

— Beaches where oil washed up within weeks of a spill were supposed to be safe from contamination because BP promised it could marshal more than enough boats to scoop up all the oil before any deepwater spill could reach shore — a claim that in retrospect seems absurd.

""The vessels in question maintain the necessary spill containment and recovery equipment to respond effectively,"" one of the documents says.

BP asserts that the combined response could skim, suck up or otherwise remove 20 million gallons of oil each day from the water. But that is about how much has leaked in the past six weeks — and the slick now covers about 3,300 square miles, according to Hans Graber, director of the University of Miami's satellite sensing facility. Only a small fraction of the spill has been successfully skimmed. Plus, an undetermined portion has sunk to the bottom of the Gulf or is suspended somewhere in between.

The plan uses computer modeling to project a 21 percent chance of oil reaching the Louisiana coast within a month of a spill. In reality, an oily sheen reached the Mississippi River delta just nine days after the April 20 explosion. Heavy globs soon followed. Other locales where oil washed up within weeks of the explosion were characterized in BP's regional plan as safely out of the way of any oil danger.

— BP's site plan regarding birds, sea turtles or endangered marine mammals (""no adverse impacts"") also have proved far too optimistic.

While the exact toll on the Gulf's wildlife may never be known, the effects clearly have been devastating.

More than 400 oiled birds have been treated, while dozens have been found dead and covered in crude, mainly in Louisiana but also in Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. More than 200 lifeless turtles, several dolphins and countless fish also have washed ashore.

The response plans anticipate nothing on this scale. There weren't supposed to be any coastline problems because the site was far offshore.

""Due to the distance to shore (48 miles) and the response capabilities that would be implemented, no significant adverse impacts are expected,"" the site plan says.

But that distance has failed to protect precious resources. And last week, a group of environmental research center scientists released a computer model that suggested oil could ride ocean currents around Florida and up to North Carolina by summer.

— Perhaps the starkest example of BP's planning failures: The company has insisted that the size of the leak doesn't matter because it has been reacting to a worst-case scenario all along.

Yet each step of the way, as the estimated size of the daily leak has grown from 42,000 gallons to 210,000 gallons to perhaps 1.8 million gallons, BP has been forced to scramble — to create potential solutions on the fly, to add more boats, more boom, more skimmers, more workers. And containment domes, top kills, top hats.

___

While a disaster as devastating as a major oil spill will create unforeseen problems, BP's plans do not anticipate even the most obvious issues, and use mountains of words to dismiss problems that have proven overwhelming.

In responses to lengthy lists of questions from AP, the Interior Department, which oversees the MMS, appears to concede there were problems with the two oil spill response plans.

""Many of the questions you raise are exactly those questions that will be examined and answered by the presidential commission as well as other investigations into BP's oil spill,"" said Kendra Barkoff, spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. She added that Salazar has undertaken reforms of MMS.

A key failure of the plan's cleanup provisions was the scarcity of boom — floating lines of plastic or absorbent material placed around sensitive areas to deflect oil.

From the start, local officials all along the Gulf Coast have complained about a lack of supplies, particularly the heavier, so-called ocean boom. But even BP says in its regional plan that boom isn't effective in seas more than three to four feet; waves in the Gulf are often bigger. And even in calmer waters, oil has swamped vital wildlife breeding grounds in places supposedly sequestered by multiple layers of boom.

The BP plans speak of thorough resources for all; there's no talk of a need to share. Still, Alabama Gov. Bob Riley said his shores were left vulnerable by Coast Guard decisions to shift boom to Louisiana when the oil threatened landfall there.

Meanwhile, in Louisiana's Plaquemines Parish, some have complained that miles of the boom now in the water were not properly anchored. AP reporters saw evidence they're right — some lines of boom were so broken up they hardly impeded the slick's push to shore.

Some out-of-state contractors misplaced boom because they didn't know local waters, yet disorganization has dogged efforts to use local boats. In Venice, La., near where the Mississippi River empties into the Gulf, a large group of charter captains have been known to spend their days sitting around at the marina, earning $2,000 a day without ever attacking the oil.

Fox News,Area 51 Raid,'Storm Area 51' raid brings alien 'community of believers' to Nevada desert,"From the bright lights and bustling streets of downtown Las Vegas' famous Fremont Street to the dusty and dry remote Nevada high-desert, ""Storm Area 51"" hype has brought out the true believers in-force who are certain we are not alone in the universe.

At the Alien Research Center in Hiko, Nev., where the ""Storm Area 51 Basecamp"" will take place Friday and Saturday, a steady stream of people perused alien-inspired gifts in the store such as magnets, T-shirts, and Christmas ornaments, with many decked out to impress visitors from another world.

Kelly Bourbon from Las Vegas and Angel (who did not provide her last name), from Wichita, Kan., sported similar-looking T-shirts that read ""Mars Needs Women"" and ""Beam Us Up"" as they explained they've followed ""anything and everything alien"" ever since they were little and heard stories about UFOs from their fathers who worked at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

""We figure Mars needs women, so we're here if they want to beam us up,"" Angel said.

'STORM AREA 51': HAVE YOU INTEREST IN SEEING THE MYSTERIOUS SITE'S ENTRANCE? TAKE A PEEK

Area 51 is popularly known as the site of rumored government studies of extraterrestrials. The ""Storm Area 51"" Facebook event went viral in July as people pledged to crash the secret military base in an attempt to ""see them aliens."" More than 2 million Facebook users have now said they are going, with over 1.4 million replying they were interested.

Two festivals have since popped up since the event went viral, one in Rachel, and the other in Hiko. Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee told reporters on Thursday afternoon at a briefing that perhaps 1,500 people had been drawn to the two tiny desert towns, with more than 150 making the trek on dirt roads to visit the two gates of the Area 51 U.S. Air Force installation.

The Air Force has issued stern warnings for people not to try to enter the Nevada Test and Training Range, where Area 51 is located.

""It's public land,"" the sheriff said. ""They're allowed to go to the gate, as long as they don't cross the boundary.""

Brandon Ruth, who is visiting Nevada for the first time during this weekend of hype, said that the idea of ""storming"" the military site was one of the ""silliest ideas ever.""

Ruth, who served in the Army for around just over six years, added that anyone who tries to raid a government base will ""will go straight to prison and you will not collect $200 and/or you will be shot and killed, unfortunately.""

""There's a lot of secrets over there that they want to keep a secret and it's for our safety and everybody else's safety and it's for our benefit,"" he told Fox News. ""I would strongly recommend everybody stay as far away from the base as possible.""

'STORM AREA 51': STRANGE TIMES OUT ON THE 'EXTRATERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY'

At the Storm Area 51 Basecamp, organizers are looking to promote a microphone for the movement to expose UFO secrecy instead of any ""storming."" Guy Malone told Fox News he hopes this weekend's event is a success that then turns into an annual tradition for those who believe in life outside of Earth.

""It's a community of believers where people can have a ton of fun if they don't take it too seriously and turn it into their religious beliefs,"" Malone said.

For Ben Gary Winthorp and Michael Fortner, there were mixed opinions about what really lurks in the secret Nevada site.

""I believe in aliens, I don't believe in aliens at Area 51,"" Winthorp said Thursday.

The pair, who frequently go to festivals — including Winthorp who was still sporting a neck brace after an injury at a recent festival — both believe that there's someone out there ""crazy enough to jump into Area 51.""

""This is the most millennial thing to happen,"" Fortner told Fox News.

Alienstock: From Vegas to global?

In downtown Las Vegas, the relocated Alienstock festival from the California man who created the initial Facebook event featured an assortment of food and cocktail stands, carnival rides, and special cans from event presenter Bud Light featuring a green alien in the background.

The Bud Light Area 51 Celebration, which was free to attend, had Matty Roberts spend two hours signing everything from T-shirts to people's arms. Roberts, who thanked the crowd for coming to the 'f----n"" show,' also shared what lies in store for the hype his event created.

""Alienstock's already going on tour, we already have like a bunch of nightclubs across the United States that are wanting us to take Alienstock to their venues and they want me to host the party,"" he told FOX5. ""So, it's going global and it's going to be amazing.""

Some who were at the downtown Las Vegas event said they still going to head to the other festivals after.

""I figured it would just be a bunch of people drinking in the desert, I knew I was right,"" Arielle Aquinas told Fox News, adding she's a big sci-fi fan and believer in aliens.

""The proof is there,"" she said.

'Experiencing low activity'

While neighboring Lincoln County has planned events in Rachel and Hiko, Nye County has not permitted any festivals or large gatherings.

As of Thursday, that appears to have kept things quiet as officials said that the Nye County Department of Emergency Management and the Nye County Sheriff’s Office is ""experiencing low activity"" regarding people gathering within the area in support of the possible Storm Area 51 events.

""Traffic levels on U.S. Highway 95 through Amargosa Valley and Beatty continue to be slightly elevated but flowing smoothly through those communities,"" officials said in a news release.

Sharon Wehrly, the sheriff in adjacent Nye County, home to the Area 51 Alien Center, said messages discouraging Earthlings from trying to find extraterrestrials in Amargosa Valley appeared to work. She reported no arrests or incidents Thursday.

Last week, deputies arrested two Dutch tourists attracted by ""Storm Area 51."" The men pleaded guilty to trespassing at a secure U.S. site nowhere near Area 51 and were sentenced to three days in jail after promising to pay nearly $2,300 each in fines.

Fox News,Brett Kavanaugh picked for SCJ,Trump nominates Brett Kavanaugh to Supreme Court,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

President Trump nominated appeals court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court Monday night to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, ending a days-long guessing game that began the moment Kennedy announced his retirement and setting the stage for a grueling confirmation fight.

In televised remarks from the East Room of the White House, the president praised what he called Kavanaugh's ""impeccable credentials, unsurpassed qualifications and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law.""

""There is no one in America more qualified for this position, and no one more deserving,"" Trump said.

Kavanaugh had been considered a front-runner ever since Kennedy's June 27 retirement announcement. Trump conducted a swift and decisive vetting process, eager to push for confirmation of his second Supreme Court pick in less than two years.

Though the president said Monday his nominee deserves ""robust bipartisan support,"" many Democratic lawmakers had vowed even before the announcement to oppose Trump's choice. In his own remarks, Kavanaugh looked ahead to what's expected to be a bruising confirmation fight: ""I will tell each senator that I revere the Constitution. I believe that an independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic.

""If confirmed by the Senate, I will keep an open mind in every case, and I will always strive to preserve the Constitution of the United States and the American rule of law.""

He said a judge ""must interpret the law, not make the law.""

The four finalists – Kavanaugh and fellow appeals court judges Amy Coney Barrett, Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge – were drawn from a list of 25 names vetted by conservative groups.

A clue to Kavanaugh’s nomination emerged hours before the announcement when the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a written opinion in which the judge sided with the majority. The D.C. court does not typically issue opinions on Mondays except in response to emergency petitions, suggesting the case had to be disposed of before Kavanaugh was nominated for the high court.

In the hours leading up to Trump's announcement, crowds of pro-choice and pro-life protesters gathered outside the Supreme Court building. Some chanted ""Kavanaugh has got to go"" as news of the nomination spread through the crowd. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., spoke to the crowd and led an anti-Kavanaugh chant, though her own words were drowned out by protesters.

The protests were a snapshot of the intense battle to come, on Capitol Hill and in midterm races across the country where the nomination will factor heavily.

Kavanaugh has a deep judicial record, having written about 300 opinions.

A former law clerk to Kennedy in 1993, he was elevated to the powerful federal appeals court in the District of Columbia by President George W. Bush, under whom he had served as a White House lawyer and staff secretary. Kavanaugh, 53, also won the confidence of key players in the Bush circle such as strategist Karl Rove.

This, however, had risked being something of a double-edged sword for Kavanaugh in the Trump era, raising concerns among some Trump supporters that he was too much of a D.C. insider and too closely associated with the Bush circle.

The Bush connections also harmed him with Democrats at the time of his initial nomination, who delayed his confirmation. But despite the criticism, he wore his support for Bush on his sleeve. It remains to be seen if those ties will complicate his confirmation process now -- both with Democrats and Trump’s base.

In a statement, Bush said Trump had made an ""outstanding decision"" in nominating Kavanaugh.

""Brett is a brilliant jurist who has faithfully applied the Constitution and laws throughout his 12 years on the D.C. Circuit. He is a fine husband, father, and friend – and a man of the highest integrity. He will make a superb Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.""

Trump may have been swayed in part because of Kavanaugh’s record of being a reliable conservative on the court – and reining in dozens of administrative decisions of the Obama White House. There are some question marks for conservatives, particularly an ObamaCare ruling years ago.

In a 2011 case, Kavanaugh acknowledged in his dissent that the Affordable Care Act’s “individual mandate provision” could fit “comfortably within Congress’ Taxing Clause power.” His detractors say that language helped provide the road map for the Supreme Court to uphold the mandate a year later.

However, supporters of Kavanaugh have pushed back against that argument. Justin Walker, a former Kavanaugh clerk, argued that the judge’s “hypothetical discussion” about the Taxing Clause has been misinterpreted and is actually “a road map to the conclusion reached by the dissenters—that the individual mandate is unconstitutional under the Taxing Clause.”

It’s also unclear how Kavanaugh would rule on abortion, as he has never directly confronted the issue as a judge. Last year, Kavanaugh dissented from a decision allowing an illegal immigrant to receive an abortion, but pro-life conservatives have criticized him for not going far enough. Specifically, they have expressed concern about language where Kavanaugh wrote “the unlawful immigrant minor is assumed to have a right under precedent to an abortion.”

The administration announced earlier Monday that former Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona would guide the nominee through the Senate confirmation process. Before retiring in 2013, Kyl was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will be the first to consider the nomination. The White House hopes Kyl's close ties to Senate Republicans will help smooth the path for Kavanaugh.

In addition, the conservative group Judicial Crisis Network will launch a $1.4 million ad buy in support of Kavanaugh, running advertisements in Alabama, Indiana, North Dakota, and West Virginia – states with Democratic senators on the fence about supporting Trump’s nominee.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer vowed Monday to oppose Kavanaugh's nomination ""with everything I have,"" saying that Trump had ""has put reproductive rights and freedoms and health care protections for millions of Americans on the judicial chopping block.""

""If Americans believe in a woman's right to make her own reproductive choices, and that health insurance companies shouldn't be able to charge people more based on pre-existing conditions, now is the time to fight,"" Schumer said. ""Im calling on Americans from all walks of life to make their voices heard from now until the end of this battle.""

A senior White House source told Fox News that five Democratic senators – Judiciary Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Doug Jones of Alabama, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia – were invited to attend the nomination announcement. All five declined.

Of the five, Donnelly, Heitkamp and Manchin voted to confirm Gorsuch last year -- and are up for re-election. Jones, who was elected to the Senate in a December 2017 special election after Gorsuch was confirmed, is not up for re-election until 2020. He told CNN on Sunday that he was “not an automatic, knee-jerk no” on any of the potential nominees.

Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, seen as most likely among Republicans to consider voting against a Trump nomination, also declined invitations to attend.

Fox News,George Floyd Death,Protesters clash with Minneapolis police after George Floyd’s death,"Chaos broke out on Tuesday night in Minneapolis as protesters took to the streets to demand action after the death of George Floyd, a Minnesota man who died in police custody a day earlier.

Police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades on some protesters, reports said. The protest started peacefully, but the situation deteriorated and some demonstrators were seen breaking windows of police cars and hurling rocks, reports said.

Floyd, 46, died Monday night and video later emerged showing the man on the ground with a police officer pressing his knee against Floyd's neck. Footage released of the incident showed Floyd shouting, “I cannot breathe” and “Don’t kill me.”

GEORGE FLOYD'S COUSINS SPEAK OUT ABOUT HEARTBREAK OVER HIS DEATH IN MINNEAPOLIS POLICE CUSTODY

Officers had responded to a call from a grocery store that claimed Floyd had allegedly used a forged check.

Floyd's death sparked new tensions between police and the black community.

“We’re here to let them know this can’t be tolerated; there will be severe consequences if they continue to kill us. This will not go on another day,” a protester said, according to Minneapolis's WCCO-TV.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., released a statement on Tuesday and called it another ""horrifying and gut-wrenching instance of an African-American man dying.""

The protests began on the south side of Minneapolis, near where Floyd was arrested. Protesters were seen sitting in the crosswalks and using their own vehicles to block traffic. Organizers emphasized keeping this protest peaceful, but chaos began to swell during the day, according to Fox 9 Minneapolis.

Some carried signs reading “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops,"" according to the Guardian.

Protesters continued to block traffic during the evening. As the crowds grew, the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota reminded protesters to keep their distance to help stop the spread of COVID-19, WCCO reported.

The sounds of motorcycles revving were also captured on video as they sent crowds running during the protest, with many demonstrators confused as to what was happening, according to the station.

The protesters later moved toward the Minneapolis Police Department's 3rd precinct, where crowds swelled. People were seen throwing rocks at the building, as well as at police cruisers -- with one being sprayed with paint, according to FOX 9.

Protesters threw water and milk bottles at the officers, shouting “pigs” and “how could you,"" the Guardian reported. Police fired green teargas and stun grenades to disperse the crowd approaching the station.

“It’s real ugly. The police have to understand that this is the climate they have created, this is the climate they created,” another protester said, according to WCCO.

4 MINNEAPOLIS OFFICERS FIRED IN DEATH OF BLACK MAN AFTER VIDEO SHOWS OFFICER PINNING KNEE AGAINST HIS NECK

As rains came down in the city, demonstrators were seen using carts at a Target store as cover before police launched tear gas.

The four officers were terminated Tuesday. Klobuchar called the firings a step in the right direction on Tuesday.

""Those responsible must still be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,"" she added. ""Justice must be served.""

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., later called the actions by police ""a disgusting display.""

""I’m here on the southside, helping people as I can with milk, water and towels,"" she said. ""So far, I have been unable to prevent the police from firing indiscriminately into the crowd. Moments ago, I held a towel to a teenage girl's head as blood poured from it""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced Tuesday that the officers involved had been fired after they were initially placed on paid leave. The FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) are investigating Floyd's death.

Ben Crump, an attorney for the Floyd family, told TMX.news the officer shown in the video with his knee on Floyd's neck should be charged with murder and that the other officers should be charged as accomplices.

MINNESOTA HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY GRADUATION CEREMONY EXPOSED PEOPLE TO CORONAVIRUS

""They were supposed to protect and serve citizens like George,"" Crump said. ""We in black America, we are done dying at the hands of the people who are supposed to protect and serve us.""

Police said the man appeared to be intoxicated and that he resisted arrest, although it wasn't clear if that was accurate. Body cameras were rolling the whole time, according to police spokesman John Elder.

Floyd's death has prompted comparisons to that of Eric Garner, an African-American man whose death was brought on by an illegal chokehold during a 2014 interaction with New York City police. A video showed Garner repeatedly stating ""I can't breathe"" while being choked on the ground.

The president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, Lt. Bob Kroll, said that the union intends to provide full support to the officers involved in the incident -- who have yet to be identified by authorities.

“Now is not the time rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers,” Kroll said, according to WCCO. “An in-depth investigation is underway. Our officers are fully cooperating. We must review all video. We must wait for the medical examiner’s report.”

Floyd was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis where he died at 9:25 p.m. on Monday. The cause of his death is currently pending further testing and investigation, according to the medical examiner.

Fox News,January 6th,How Wednesday's Capitol riot came to fruition and who made it happen,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The congressional endeavor of certifying the presidential winner in the Electoral College is typically a banal ritual.

But on Wednesday after weeks of mounting emotions, lawsuits to overturn the results, and an insistence from President Trump and his supporters that the election was stolen, the ceremonial duty became a jaw-dropping event pockmarked by a raid of the Capitol, shots ringing out, tear gas and lives lost.

So what happened?

According to one U.S. military veteran heavily involved in the planning of Wednesday's protests, attendees came from across the country.

""Whether it was Veterans for Trump or Bikers for Trump or Latinos for Trump, we were all there together. We came together by action and the call of our president,"" the source, who spoke on background, told Fox News. ""Our commander-in-chief had requested our assistance, and any veteran with honor listens to the commander-in-chief. That is the spirit in which we live.""

In the days leading up to Wednesday, Trump supporters started ""pouring in,"" the source said.

""Everything was booked; you couldn't get a room. People were camping out in the cold,"" the organizer said, explaining that buses brought supporters from out-of-state. ""It was a call to action. We knew this was going to be a big day and an important point in time.""

NEW FBI WANTED POSTERS IN CAPITOL RIOT MANHUNT

Jan. 6, the date for certification of the Electoral College, began with small crowds of Trump supporters filtering into designated areas around the Ellipse for permit-approved rallies.

Around 10 a.m., in bone-chilling cold, Trump's sons and his longtime lawyer spoke to the growing crowds, and after the president's speech, in which he said he would never concede, thousands marched toward the Capitol after he suggested that they should.

""We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women,"" Trump said.

Meanwhile, many more protesters accumulated by the White House lawn.

But shortly after 1 p.m., demonstrators started clashing with law enforcement on the steps of the Capitol. Less than 30 minutes later, representatives inside the building were being evacuated amid reports of a bomb outside. And at about 2:10 p.m., rioters managed to blow past police lines and scale the walls around the building.

BLM ACTIVIST INSIDE CAPITOL CLAIMS HE WAS 'DOCUMENTING' RIOTS, ONCE SAID 'BURN IT ALL DOWN'

Within another 40 minutes, the barricades ruptured and thousands headed into the chambers with anger, exhilaration, determination and confusion. After the initial scuffle and breach, word spread quickly through social media forums and scores followed each others' footsteps inside.

From the one insider's point-of-view, the ""doors were already open to them, and the barricades had been pulled down already."" People simply ""wanted to be heard in the chambers,"" they ""wanted their voices heard,"" and were ""sick and tired of what had been going on.""

Trump eventually urged backers to protest ""peacefully and patriotically,"" but the chaos continued.

But whether or not detailed plans to overrun the federal building had been set in motion earlier was subject to debate. One Washington security employee connected to the White House told Fox News that it's likely 95% of the attendees were there to protest non-violently. Still, there was likely a sub-section of attendees with more violent intentions.

""Many of the attackers appeared dressed for a riot – suggesting some element of planning,"" said Jordan Strauss, managing director of business intelligence and investigations at Kroll, a division of New York-based risk consultancy Duff & Phelps. ""But I suspect that it was a combination, with some individuals having announced themselves as having come to storm the Capitol or incite some sort of revolution. It would surprise me if some otherwise peaceful protesters were not swept up in the fever of the moment and decided to cross the threshold from peaceful protesters to criminals on the spot.""

Nonetheless, the drawing in of MAGA devotees and Trump loyalists for the coveted date had long been in the works, mostly through Facebook pages and online groups – many of which are above-board, registered non-profit 501c3s.

According to a number of those who attended Wednesday's events, the big push began after Trump tweeted on Dec. 19: ""Big protest in D.C. on January 6. Be there, be wild!""

Flyers, pinpointing three locations to meet, quickly appeared under the headline ""Trump Wants to See You in D.C."" Open-source discussions about flight costs and places to stay grew. Some prepared to bring bulletproof clothing and weapons for protection, expressing concern over countering Antifa activists.

""There's often little sophistication to how these events are planned,"" said Ryan Schonfeld, founder & CEO, RAS Security Group. ""The ability to respond in a coordinated manner is possible with the right combination of people and technology making sense of the available data. An exacerbating factor is misinformation, often spread through the use of fake social media and online accounts and profiles.""

Momentum, augmented heavily by Trump's rhetoric, continued to gather as the reckoning day to ""stop the steal"" neared. Several already well-established contingencies supporting the president continued to encourage backers to show up, and new Facebook groups echoing the rallying cry surfaced. While less-regulated social media sites such as Gab and Parler have become common platforms for protest discussions, several of those involved told Fox News that most communication was not underground or via encryption, but open-source.

""We augment and push out our events through social media messaging, and we have direct coordinators and influencers (with large followings) who help in letting our supporters know event times and locations,"" the source continued. ""The point was to be there for the president. All of these patriot groups wanted to be there. We don't want to see the theft of America or a banana republic.""

Last Friday, the first day of 2021, after a surprise early departure from his Florida's Mar-a-Lago residence before ringing in the New Year with his most ardent donors, Trump tweeted that the ""BIG Protest Rally"" would begin at 11 a.m. on Jan. 6.

The rally was set against a backdrop of failed lawsuits advocated by Lin Wood, Sidney Powell and others to overturn Joe Biden's November victory. And Trump supporters' hopes that he would remain in the White House were revived by the Jan. 2 declaration by 12 Republican senators including Josh Hawley of Missouri and Texas' Ted Cruz to lodge objections to the Electoral College certification.

TRUMP SAYS HE 'WILL NOT BE GOING' TO BIDEN'S INAUGURATION

But how and why the Capitol was so easily breached remains a sore point many security experts are piecing together. Officials have contended that despite weeks of planning between federal and local law enforcement agencies, which also entailed social media monitoring, there was no intelligence to indicate the historic chaos.

The ""lack of intel"" line sparked further conspiracies by those at the rally.

Some involved in Wednesday's breach still maintain that it was never their intention -- and rather, that anti-Trump agitators initiated it.

Another pro-Trump activist vowed that there were ""different anarchists involved,"" some of whom took advantage of ""trying to get patriotic, emotionally charged people to do something stupid"" -- like following the leader into the Capitol.

Nonetheless, the whole episode shook the Washington security apparatus to the core.

As Chris Edwards, director of Tax Policy Studies at the libertarian-leaning CATO Institute, said it would be hard for the Capitol Police to complain about underfunding.

""The force has 2,300 officers and a $516 million budget to defend two square miles,"" Edwards said.

Spending on the police force increased from $115 million in 2000 to an estimated $516 million for 2021, he said.

""That equals an annual average growth rate of 7.4 percent, much faster than the 2.1 percent average annual inflation over the period, Edwards said. ""The Capitol Police budget is more than the police budgets of Atlanta and Detroit.""

In the end, at least five people -- including a police officer defending the Capitol, and military veteran and Trump adherent Ashli Babbitt, who was shot as she entered through a window -- died. So far, police have made more than 68 arrests, 41 of them on Capitol turf and only one identified as Washington resident, authorities have said.

And yet, for many Americans who still stand by the unfounded notion of a fraudulent 2020 election, in the aftermath of Wednesday's bloodshed and with Biden's inauguration just 12 days away, they are still firmly committed to the pro-Trump cause.

NBC,Obama Elected,Obama Wins: NBC Calls Historic Election for Barack Obama,"Barack Obama has been projected the winner of the 2008 Presidential Election, making him the first black man elected commander in chief in America's 232-year history.

With the Democratic candidate already sitting at 207 electoral votes, Obama was called the winner in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. The additional 81 electoral votes were enough to secure his victory, reported MSNBC.

John McCain dominated the Southeast corner of the map all night, picking up the 6 electoral votes in Mississippi, and added North Dakota to his column as well, but found himself in a deep hole.

McCain had slowed Barack Obama's momentum by picking up Texas and Utah, just moments after Obama had secured what could be a decisive victory in Ohio, being awarded the battleground state's 20 electoral votes.

Obama quickly responded to McCain's two wins by taking Iowa's 7 electoral votes. It was there that Obama's candidacy shifted into high gear with his caucus victory over Hillary Clinton in January.

Obama had earlier followed up his big win in Ohio with his second red state victory in New Mexico, earning 5 more electoral votes. Every candidate who has taken Ohio since Abraham Lincoln has won the election and no Republican has ever won the presidency without the state.

Obama's win in New Mexico was likely helped in part by the endorsement he received from the state's Gov. Bill Richardson, who has been mentioned as a possible Secretary of State in an Obama administration.

McCain picked up West Virginia's 5 electoral votes shortly past 9:30 p.m. (EST). McCain had earlier won Arkansas' 6 electoral votes. This came moments after his victories Kansas, North Dakota and Wyoming. Meanwhile, Obama picked up Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Rhode Island and New York.

The next round of closures came at 10, with Iowa, Montana, Nevada and Utah shutting it down. An hour later California, Hawaii, Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon and Washington all called it quits, leaving only Alaska in play. Gov. Sarah Palin's home state closes its polls at 1 a.m.

McCain had made an 11th-hour plea to Colorado voters earlier, encouraging them to ignore the pundits and polls that have predicted an inglorious defeat for the Arizona senator.

""America is worth fighting for. Nothing is inevitable here,"" the GOP nominee told his final rally of a marathon campaign.

Believing he still has a puncher's chance in Colorado and other western states that have shown a recent tightening in the polls, McCain broke his Election Day tradition of going to the movies and instead flew to a raucous airport rally in Grand Junction.

""I feel the momentum. I feel it, you feel it, and we're going to win the election,"" the former Navy pilot told several thousand supporters.

He then headed to New Mexico for one final campaign stop before returning to Arizona to watch election returns.

While McCain was making his swing through the west, Barack Obama was in Indiana, trying to flip the Republican-leaning state.

""It's going to be tight as a tick here in Indiana,"" Obama told volunteers at the center with only seven hours to go in the area's balloting. ""So the question is who wants it more.""

As McCain and Obama made last-minute campaign appearances, the man they seek to replace remained MIA.

Pres. George Bush has done more than most to help propel Obama's candidacy. Since being anointed the Democratic candidate, Obama has been pounding away on McCain, telling voters that the Arizona represents ""four more years of the same failed policies.""

Ever dutiful, White House press secretary Dana Perino explained her boss' disappearance as a matter of courtesy.

""He realizes this election is not about him,"" said Perino.

For her part, First Lady Laura Bush has been waiting for the race's conclusion. ""I'm really looking forward to Election Day,"" she said at a Republican campaign event in Kentucky on Monday, ""partly because it seems like George has been on the ticket this entire year.""

It was clear for some time that McCain's path to victory was a narrow and precarious one. The polling analysts at FiveThirtyEight predict an Obama victory by 349 to 189 in the Electoral College.

But McCain has always been most comfortable on the stump when he's trailing.

""I'm very happy with where we are. We always do best when I'm a bit of an underdog,"" McCain told ""Good Morning America"" on ABC in an interview hours before polls opened.

""You can't imagine, you can't imagine the excitement of an individual to be this close to the most important position in the world, and I'll enjoy it. I'll never forget it as long as I live.""",https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/politics/decision_day/2112662/

NBC,Japan Earthquake & Tsunamis,"Millions without food, water, power in Japan","







SENDAI, Japan — Millions of people were without drinking water, electricty or adequate food Sunday as the death toll from a devastating earthquake and tsunami was climbing along Japan's northeast coast.

Japan's government ordered 100,000 troops to join the rescue and recovery effort after thousands of survivors huddled over heaters in emergency shelters through a second freezing night.

Adding to the country's woes, from an unstable nuclear reactor in Fukushima prefecture, near Sendai.

Japan's nuclear safety agency reported that radioactive cesium and iodine were detected near the facility Saturday. The detection of the materials, which are created during atomic fission, prompted the company to acknowledge that the reactor's fuel had partially melted, The reactor also was rocked by an explosion on Saturday, but authorities said the blast did not damage the containment structure surrounding the reactor.

Japan's Meteorological Agency said it had upgraded the magnitude of Friday's catastrophic earthquake to 9.0. The agency earlier measured it at 8.8.

The quake was already the biggest to hit Japan since record-keeping began in the late 1800s and one of the biggest ever recorded in the world. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake at 8.9.

Aerial footage from the hardest-hit areas showed buildings and trains strewn like children's toys after powerful walls of seawater swamped areas around the worst-hit city of Sendai, about 100 miles from the earthquake's epicenter.

Teams searched for the missing along hundreds of miles of the coast, and thousands of hungry survivors huddled in darkened emergency centers that were cut off from rescuers and aid. At least 1.4 million households had gone without water since the quake struck and some 2.5 million households were without electricity.

Large areas of the countryside were surrounded by water and unreachable. Fuel stations were closed and people were running out of gasoline for their cars.

Public broadcaster NHK said around 380,000 people have been evacuated to emergency shelters, many of them without power.

In Iwanuma, not far from Sendai, nurses and doctors were rescued Saturday after spelling S.O.S. on the rooftop of a partially submerged hospital, one of many desperate scenes. In cities and towns across the northeast, worried relatives checked information boards on survivors at evacuation centers.



Helicopters also plucked survivors from an elementary school in Sendai.

100,000 troops dispatchedThe government doubled the number of troops ordered into the rescue and recovery operations to 100,000.

''First and foremost, we need to make full efforts in saving lives and rescuing people,'' Prime Minister Naoto Kan said.

The military forces were helping evacuate survivors from the quake-damaged area, with about 300,000 relocated so far, according to Kyodo.

The scale of destruction was overwhelming, with grim signs that the death toll — officially in the hundreds — could soar. A police official in Miyagi said another 200 bodies were found Sunday. One report said four whole trains had disappeared Friday and still had not been found. Others said 9,500 people in one coastal town were unaccounted for.

Atsushi Ito, an official in Miyagi prefecture, among the worst-hit states, could not confirm that, noting that with so little access to the area, thousands of people in scores of towns could not be contacted.

Early Sunday, firefighters had yet to contain a large blaze at the Cosmo Oil refinery in the city of Ichihara. Four million households remained without power. The Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported that Japan had asked for additional energy supplies from Russia.

New evacuations orderedGovernment officials also ordered new evacuations in several coastal areas as they warned that aftershocks may trigger new tsunamis. Residents were told to head for higher ground.

More than 150 aftershocks — including a 6.8 temblor just before noon Saturday — followed Friday's massive quake. Another, Sunday morning, a 6.2 earthquake centered just 111 miles east of Tokyo at a depth of 15.2 miles, swayed buildings in the capital.

President Barack Obama pledged U.S. help following what he called a potentially ""catastrophic"" disaster. One U.S. aircraft carrier is already in Japan and a second was on its way, he said. A U.S. ship also was also heading to the U.S.-owned Marianas Islands to assist, he added.

The situation in Sendai, one of the cities nearest to the epicenter of the earthquake, which occurred about 80 to 100 miles offshore, was particularly grim.

""Everything is so hard now,"" said Kumi Onodera, a 34-year-old dental technician in Sendai, who described the quake and tsunami that quickly followed as being ""like a scene from a disaster movie.""

""The road was moving up and down like a wave. Things were on fire and it was snowing,"" she said. ""You really come to appreciate what you have in your everyday life.""

Weary, mud-spattered survivors wandered streets strewn with fallen trees, crumpled cars, even small airplanes. Relics of lives now destroyed were everywhere — half a piano, a textbook, a soiled red sleeping bag.

Rescue workers rode boats through murky waters around flooded structures, nosing their way through a sea of detritus, while smoke from at least one large fire billowed in the distance. Power and phone reception was cut, while hundreds of people lined up outside the few still-operating supermarkets for basic necessities. The gas stations on streets not covered with water were swamped with people waiting to fill their cars.

To the south of Sendai, in Iwaki city, many area residents spent the night outdoors, or wandering debris-strewn streets, unable to return to homes damaged or destroyed by the quake or tsunami. Those who did find a place to rest for the night awoke to scenes of utter devastation.

The city's Wakabayashi district, which runs down to the sea, remained a swampy wasteland with murky, waist-high water. Most houses were completely flattened, as if a giant bulldozer had swept through.

In Iwaki town, residents were leaving due to concerns they over dwindling food and fuel supplies. The town had no electricity and all stores were closed. Local police had taken in about 90 people and given them blankets and rice balls but there was no sign of government or military aid trucks.

In the small town of Tagajo, near the hard-hit port city of Sendai, dazed residents roamed streets cluttered with smashed cars, broken homes and twisted metal.

Supplies running lowIn districts around Fukushima, survivors lined up for drinking water in town centers, filling teapots and plastic containers.

Surreal and desperate scenes were commonplace: Off Japan's northeastern coast, an oil tanker lay eerily stranded in shallow water. Inland, in Sendai, a black minivan perched perilously on a metal post.

In Tokyo, which lies about 300 miles from the epicenter and where many have long feared the prospect of another monster earthquake of the scale of one that killed about 140,000 people in 1923, residents struggled to come to terms with damage inflicted on the country and their city.

Some were relieved the damage in the capital was not greater — in great part due to stringent building codes — but many remained panic-stricken about the continuing chaos.

""People make manuals for earthquakes, but when the earthquake actually happens, can you actually follow the manual?"" said 60-year-old officer worker Kiyoshi Kanazawa.

""Everyone runs away when things are shaking, and they ask you to stop the gas and fire in your house, but you do not have enough space for this in your brain.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna42044293
NBC,House Speaker,Speaker of the House Pelosi makes history,"It’s a glass ceiling no one else has even cracked, and Nancy Pelosi crashed through it Thursday, elected the nation’s first-ever female House speaker.

“I accept this gavel in the spirit of partnership, not partisanship, and look forward to working with you on behalf of the American people,” Pelosi said in a speech to colleagues and the nation. “In this House, we may belong to different parties, but we serve one country.”

The 66-year-old San Francisco Democrat beamed and clapped as she heard the voice vote catapulting her to the House’s top post. She was surrounded on the House floor by her six grandchildren, including Paul Michael Vos, born to her daughter Alexandra in early November.

After her election by a vote of 233-202, Pelosi stood holding the sleeping infant — who did not stir — and shook hands as she accepted congratulations from her fellow House members.

“Today I thank my colleagues. By electing me as speaker you have brought us closer to the ideal of equality that is America’s heritage and America’s hope,” Pelosi said. “This is an historic moment — for the Congress, and for the women of America. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights.”

Pelosi had entered the chamber to prolonged cheers from fellow House members and the packed visitors’ galleries, where onlookers included actor Richard Gere and singer Tony Bennett, crooner of “I Left My Heart in San Francisco.”

As the roll was called to seal her election and one Democrat after another shouted out her name, Pelosi sat smiling broadly, holding one grandchild and then another.

'Broken the marble ceiling'

“For our daughters and granddaughters, today we have broken the marble ceiling,” she said. “For our daughters and our granddaughters now, the sky is the limit.”



Pelosi began her history-making day running into anti-abortion demonstrators as she went to a prayer service with her husband, Paul, and a daughter at St. Peter’s Catholic Church near the Capitol.

“You can’t be Catholic and pro-abortion,” read one placard. Pelosi and her entourage walked past the small group of protesters without saying anything.

Attending the service with her were Republican leaders that her party put into the minority in the November election: new Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio and Minority Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri.

Also there were new House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland, a one-time Pelosi rival elected by House Democrats to be her No. 2 over her protests, and Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean.

She also attended a ceremonial swearing-in of the Congressional Black Caucus, where the incoming leader of the 42-member group, Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, D-Mich., made clear that they intended to have a voice in the new Congress. “She must deliver, because black people delivered that we might have this majority,” Kilpatrick said of Pelosi.

The House convened at midday with Democrats rejoicing over taking control of Congress after 12 years in the minority.

Coming-out events

But the spotlight belonged to Pelosi, and she was making the most of it with a whirlwind of festivities from the lavish to the sentimental. The week was her coming-out to the nation, and she was aiming to introduce herself not just as the San Francisco liberal decried by Republicans, but also as an Italian-American Catholic, mother of five and native of gritty Baltimore, where her father was mayor.

“We look forward to the rest of the country appreciating the real San Francisco values, of diversity and a city of dreamers, “San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said after attending a brunch in her honor. “You can only exploit the gay community so much ... They’re going to see there’s so much more to San Francisco.”

Throughout, the symbolism of Pelosi’s triumph for women was center stage.

Outside a brunch Thursday at the Library of Congress, leaders from the National Organization for Women greeted her with a giant congratulation card. The message: Way to Go!

“This is a historic moment for women everywhere,” said NOW President Kim Gandy.

Thursday evening, Pelosi was being feted at a $1,000-a-head concert hosted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee at the National Building Museum with performances expected from Carole King, Bennett, Wyclef Jean and others.

Pelosi attended Mass Wednesday at Trinity University, where she’s an alumnus, and dined that night at the Italian embassy.

Friday begins with an open house event across from the Capitol. Then she heads to Baltimore, where the street where she grew up in Little Italy is being dedicated in her honor: Nancy D’Alesandro Pelosi Via.

Pelosi was raised there, the daughter of New Deal Maryland congressman Thomas D’Alesandro, who later became the city’s mayor. She didn’t run for the House herself until 1987 after marrying wealthy businessman Paul Pelosi, moving to San Francisco and raising her children.

In Congress Pelosi displayed the tough politicking of her childhood environment. She wrung loyalties, counted votes and muscled aside Hoyer to become Democrats’ second-in-command, and then Democratic leader in 2002.

Personal loyalty is key to Pelosi. She tried to block Hoyer’s bid in November to become Democratic majority leader, suffering an embarrassing defeat when her preferred candidate, Pennsylvania Rep. John Murtha, lost badly.

Pelosi wins re-election by huge margins and stays true to her San Francisco constituency, voting against the Iraq war resolution and co-sponsoring legislation to end federal prohibitions against medical marijuana. Her liberalism makes some moderate Democrats leery, and she’s avoided campaigning in some conservative districts.

Gender history of Congress

It shouldn't be surprising that it took more than 200 years for Congress to select a female speaker of the House. The United States isn't exactly at the forefront when it comes to women in politics.

Women make up a larger share of the national legislature in 79 other countries, including China, Cuba, North Korea and Vietnam, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, an association of national legislatures. The United States even trails a couple of fledgling democracies: Afghanistan and Iraq.

There were 22 women in the House when Pelosi was first elected to her California district in 1987. There will be a record 71 female representatives when she takes over as speaker, giving women 16 percent of the seats.

""The biggest obstacle women candidates face is not about gender, it's about the lack of opportunity,"" said Ellen R. Malcolm, president of EMILY's List, which helps Democratic women who favor abortion rights get elected to public office. ""Ninety-eight percent of incumbents who run for re-election are re-elected in most years. ... The bottom line is there are very few opportunities.""

Once women decide to run for office, they are just as successful as men, according to experts who study the issue. However, women are much less likely to run.

One big reason is child care. Women are much more likely than men to be responsible for child care, and that doesn't always fit into the usually chaotic schedule of a member of Congress.

""All these women, even if they are extremely qualified, they are still so much involved in their family life they couldn't even consider running for office,"" said Richard Fox, professor of political science at Union College in New York.

Study conclusions

Fox did an extensive survey of women in professions that produce many lawmakers: education, business and the law. He worked on the study with Jennifer Lawless, an assistant political science professor at Brown University who ran for Congress this year, losing the Democratic primary in Rhode Island to incumbent Rep. James Langevin.

Among the conclusions:

Women are less likely than men to be asked to run for office by party leaders and other officials.

When women are asked to run, they are just as likely as men to do it.

Women are more likely than men to think they are unqualified to serve, even when they have the same qualifications as male candidates.

""A man can wake up one morning, look in the mirror and say, 'By God, I would be the best state legislator that Nebraska has ever seen,'"" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. ""Men don't need to be asked.""

Rep. Jeanette Rankin, R-Mont., was the first woman elected to Congress, in 1916, four years before the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote (women could already vote in Montana).

Politicians-in-waiting

Before 1970, more than 40 percent of the women in Congress gained office by succeeding their dead husbands. Since then, fewer than 10 percent have followed their husbands, according to data collected by Dennis Simon, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University.

The number of women in Congress has grown slowly, with the biggest jump coming in 1992, the ""Year of the Woman,"" when it nearly doubled, to 54.

Pelosi, 66, grew up in politics as the daughter and sister of Baltimore mayors. But she waited until her youngest daughter was in high school before she ran for Congress, a path followed by many women.

Women are, on average, older than men when they are first elected to Congress, giving them less time to rise in leadership, which is based largely on seniority.

Lena Saradnik was elected in November to the Arizona State Legislature for the first time at age 59. She said it would have been tough to run for political office while her daughter, now 30, was still young.

Saradnik, a Democrat from Tucson, said she could see herself joining Pelosi in Congress some day, but she's realistic about her prospects.

""If I were younger, I would probably say, absolutely,"" Saradnik said.

Saradnik said she decided to run for office after being approached by a local Democratic official. She was helped by a training program called Emerge America, which teaches public speaking, fundraising and media skills to female Democrats. Republicans have a similar programs called the Excellence in Public Service Series.

Just the beginning?

Marya Stark, executive director of Emerge America, predicted that more women will be inspired to run for office with Pelosi serving as speaker and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., being a potential candidate for president.

Pelosi embraces her role as the first female speaker, but she wants to be judged by the same standards as the 51 men who came before her.

""I have always asked my colleagues to judge me by the quality of my leadership and the results we achieve together, not as the first woman,"" Pelosi said.

But, she added: ""Becoming the first woman speaker will send a message to young girls and women across the country that anything is possible for them, that women can achieve power, wield power and breathe the air at that altitude. As the first woman speaker of the House, I will work to make certain that I will not be the last.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna16449288
NBC,Hussein Executed,"Saddam Hussein executed, ending era in Iraq","Saddam Hussein struggled briefly after American military guards handed him over to Iraqi executioners before dawn Saturday. But as his final moments approached and masked executioners slipped a black cloth and noose around his neck, he grew calm.

In a final moment of defiance, he refused a hood to cover his eyes.

Hours after Saddam faced the same fate he was accused of inflicting on countless thousands during a quarter-century of ruthless power, Iraqi state television showed grainy video of what it said was his body, the head uncovered and the neck twisted at a sharp angle.

Witnesses to the execution told NBC News’ Richard Engel that they were cheering around the body of Saddam after the hanging — three years after the deposed president was hauled from a hole in the ground by pursuing U.S. forces.

Asked if Saddam were dead, the official in the Iraqi prime minister’s office said, “Yes, the body of Saddam Hussein is in front of me.” The hanging reportedly occurred at 6:05 a.m. local time (10:05 p.m. ET).

NBC could hear cheers and celebrations in the background while talking to an official in the prime minister’s office.

By several accounts, Saddam was calm but scornful of his captors, engaging in a give-and-take with the crowd gathered to watch him die and insisting he was Iraq’s savior, not its tyrant and scourge.



“He said we are going to heaven and our enemies will rot in hell and he also called for forgiveness and love among Iraqis but also stressed that the Iraqis should fight the Americans and the Persians,” Munir Haddad, an appeals court judge who witnessed the hanging, told the British Broadcasting Corp.



Another witness, national security adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie, told The New York Times that one of the guards shouted at Saddam: “You have destroyed us. You have killed us. You have made us live in destitution.”



“I have saved you from destitution and misery and destroyed your enemies, the Persian and Americans,” Saddam responded, al-Rubaie told the Times.



“God damn you,” the guard said.



“God damn you,” responded Saddam.

Disbelief over death

A man whose testimony helped lead to Saddam’s conviction and execution before sunrise said he was shown the body because “everybody wanted to make sure that he was really executed.”

“Now, he is in the garbage of history,” said Jawad Abdul-Aziz, who lost his father, three brothers and 22 cousins in the reprisal killings that followed a botched 1982 assassination attempt against Saddam in the Shiite town of Dujail.

The post-execution footage showed the man identified as Saddam lying on a stretcher, covered in a white shroud. His neck and part of the shroud have what appear to be bloodstains. His eyes are closed.

In Baghdad’s Shiite enclave of Sadr City, hundreds of people danced in the streets while others fired guns in the air to celebrate. The government did not impose a round-the-clock curfew as it did last month when Saddam was convicted to thwart any surge in retaliatory violence.

It was a grim end for the 69-year-old leader who had vexed three U.S. presidents. Despite his ouster, Washington, its allies and the new Iraqi leaders remain mired in a fight to quell a stubborn insurgency by Saddam loyalists and a vicious sectarian conflict.

The execution took place during the year’s deadliest month for U.S. troops, with the toll reaching 109. At least 2,998 members of the U.S. military have been killed since the Iraq war began in March 2003, according to an Associated Press count.

President Bush said in a statement issued from his ranch in Texas that bringing Saddam to justice “is an important milestone on Iraq’s course to becoming a democracy that can govern, sustain and defend itself, and be an ally in the war on terror.”

He said that the execution marks the “end of a difficult year for the Iraqi people and for our troops” and cautioned that Saddam’s death will not halt the violence in Iraq.

Violence follows execution

Within hours of his death, bombings killed at least 68 people in Iraq, including one planted on a minibus that exploded in a fish market in a mostly Shiite town south of Baghdad.

Ali Hamza, a 30-year-old university professor, said he went outside to shoot his gun into the air after he learned of Saddam’s death.

“Now all the victims’ families will be happy because Saddam got his just sentence,” said Hamza, who lives in Diwaniyah, a Shiite town 80 miles south of Baghdad.

But people in the Sunni-dominated city of Tikrit, once a power base of Saddam, lamented his death.

“The president, the leader Saddam Hussein is a martyr and God will put him along with other martyrs. Do not be sad nor complain because he has died the death of a holy warrior,” said Sheik Yahya al-Attawi, a cleric at the Saddam Big Mosque.

Police blocked the entrances to Tikrit and said nobody was allowed to leave or enter the city for four days. Despite the security precaution, gunmen took to the streets of Tikrit, carrying pictures of Saddam, shooting into the air, and calling for vengeance.

Security forces also set up roadblocks at the entrance to another Sunni stronghold, Samarra, and a curfew was imposed after about 500 people took to the streets protesting the execution of Saddam.

A couple hundred people also protested the execution just outside the Anbar capital of Ramadi, and more than 2,000 people demonstrated in Adwar, the village south of Tikrit where Saddam was captured by U.S. troops hiding in an underground bunker.

In a statement, Saddam’s lawyers said that in the aftermath of his death, “the world will know that Saddam Hussein lived honestly, died honestly, and maintained his principles.”

“He did not lie when he declared his trial null,” they said.

'Special day' reserved for hanging

Saddam’s half-brother Barzan Ibrahim and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, the former chief justice of the Revolutionary Court, were not hanged along with their former leader as originally planned. Officials wanted to reserve the occasion for Saddam alone.

“We wanted him to be executed on a special day,” National Security adviser Mouwafak al-Rubaie told state-run al-Iraqiya television.

Sami al-Askari, the political adviser of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, told the AP that Saddam initially resisted when he was taken by Iraqi guards but was composed in his final moments.

He said Saddam was clad in a black suit, hat and shoes, rather than prison garb. His hat was removed and his hands tied shortly before the noose was slipped around his neck.

Saddam repeated a prayer after a Sunni Muslim cleric who was present.

“Saddam later was taken to the gallows and refused to have his head covered with a hood,” al-Askari said. “Before the rope was put around his neck, Saddam shouted: ’God is great. The nation will be victorious and Palestine is Arab.”’

Iraqi state television showed footage of guards in ski masks placing a noose around Saddam’s neck. Saddam appeared calm as he stood on the metal framework of the gallows. The footage cuts off just before the execution.

Saddam was executed at a former military intelligence headquarters in Baghdad’s Shiite neighborhood of Kazimiyah, al-Askari said. During his regime, Saddam had numerous dissidents executed in the facility, located in a neighborhood that is home to the Iraqi capital’s most important Shiite shrine — the Imam Kazim shrine.

'Strong lesson'

The Iraqi prime minister’s office released a statement that said Saddam’s execution was a “strong lesson” to ruthless leaders who commit crimes against their own people.

“We strongly reject considering Saddam as a representative of any sect in Iraq because the tyrant only represented his evil soul,” the statement said. “The door is still open for those whose hands are not tainted with the blood of innocent people to take part in the political process and work on rebuilding Iraq.”

The execution came 56 days after a court convicted Saddam and sentenced him to death for his role in the killings of 148 Shiite Muslims from Dujail. Iraq’s highest court rejected Saddam’s appeal Monday and ordered him executed within 30 days.

A U.S. judge on Friday refused to stop Saddam’s execution, rejecting a last-minute court challenge.

U.S. troops cheered as news of Saddam’s execution appeared on television at the mess hall at Forward Operating Base Loyalty in eastern Baghdad. But some soldiers expressed doubt that Saddam’s death would be a significant turning point for Iraq.

“First it was weapons of mass destruction. Then when there were none, it was that we had to find Saddam. We did that, but then it was that we had to put him on trial,” said Spc. Thomas Sheck, 25, who is on his second tour in Iraq. “So now, what will be the next story they tell us to keep us over here?”

At his death, he was in the midst of a second trial, charged with genocide and other crimes for a 1987-88 military crackdown that killed an estimated 180,000 Kurds in northern Iraq. Experts said the trial of his co-defendants was likely to continue despite his execution.

Farewell message posted

Many people in Iraq’s Shiite majority were eager to see the execution of a man whose Sunni Arab-dominated regime oppressed them and Kurds. Before the hanging, a mosque preacher in the Shiite holy city of Najaf on Friday called Saddam’s execution “God’s gift to Iraqis.”

In a farewell message to Iraqis posted Wednesday on the Internet, Saddam said he was giving his life for his country as part of the struggle against the U.S. “Here, I offer my soul to God as a sacrifice, and if he wants, he will send it to heaven with the martyrs,” he said.

One of Saddam’s lawyers, Issam Ghazzawi, said the letter was written by Saddam on Nov. 5, the day he was convicted by an Iraqi tribunal in the Dujail killings.

Najeeb al-Nauimi, a member of Saddam’s legal team, said U.S. authorities maintained physical custody of Saddam until the execution to prevent him being humiliated publicly or his corpse being mutilated, as has happened to previous Iraqi leaders deposed by force. He said they didn’t want anything to happen to further inflame Sunni Arabs.

“This is the end of an era in Iraq,” al-Nauimi said from Doha, Qatar. “The Baath regime ruled for 35 years. Saddam was vice president or president of Iraq during those years. For Iraqis, he will be very well remembered. Like a martyr, he died for the sake of his country.”

Death penalty had been suspended

Iraq’s death penalty was suspended by the U.S. military after it toppled Saddam in 2003, but the new Iraqi government reinstated it two years later, saying executions would deter criminals.

Saddam’s own regime used executions and extrajudicial killings as a tool of political repression, both to eliminate real or suspected political opponents and to maintain a reign of terror.

In the months after he seized power on July 16, 1979, he had hundreds of members of his own party and army officers slain. In 1996, he ordered the slaying of two sons-in-law who had defected to Jordan but returned to Baghdad after receiving guarantees of safety.

Saddam built Iraq into a one of the Arab world’s most modern societies, but then plunged the country into an eight-year war with neighboring Iran that killed hundreds of thousands of people on both sides and wrecked Iraq’s economy.

NBC,Swine Flu,U.S. says too many swine flu cases to count,"U.S. health officials have lost track of how many illnesses and deaths have been caused by the first global flu epidemic in 40 years.

And they did it on purpose.

Government doctors stopped counting swine flu cases in July, when they estimated more than 1 million were infected in this country. The number of deaths has been sitting at more than 600 since early September. Health officials had previously counted lab-confirmed cases, though the tally was skewed because many people who got sick never were tested.

Other nations have stopped relying on lab-confirmed cases, too, and health officials say the current monitoring system is adequate. But not having specific, accurate counts of swine flu means the government doesn't have a clear picture of how hard the infection is hitting some groups of people, said Andrew Pekosz, a flu expert at Johns Hopkins University.

The novel H1N1 flu seems to be more dangerous for children, young adults, pregnant women and even the obese, according to studies based on small numbers of patients. But exactly how much more at risk those people are is hard to gauge if the overall numbers are fuzzy.

""This wasn't as critical early on, when case numbers were low,"" said Pekosz. But now, it's hard to say exactly how swine flu's dangers vary from group to group, he said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is relying on a patchwork system of gathering death and hospitalization numbers. Some states are reporting lab-confirmed cases. Others report illnesses that could be the new swine flu, seasonal flu or some other respiratory disease.

Some say that's a more sensible approach than only counting lab-confirmed cases. Many people who got sick never get tested, so the tally of swine flu cases was off almost from the very beginning, they say.

""It was a vast underestimate,"" said Dr. Zack Moore, a respiratory disease expert for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.

What's more, as the initial panic of the new virus ebbed, fewer people were fully tested, so the results weren't as accurate or comprehensive. ""The kinds of numbers you were getting later in the summer were different from the numbers early on,"" said Dr. Daniel Jernigan, deputy director of the CDC's influenza division.

That's why the CDC shifted to counting the new flu like it counts seasonal flu cases, agency officials said. ""We're concerned folks are focused on the numbers and missing that influenza is monitored by looking at trends,"" Jernigan said.

No exact measure

It's likely that millions of Americans have been sickened by swine flu by now, CDC officials say. New York City alone estimates it had roughly 1 million cases since swine flu first hit last spring.

While everyone would like an exact measure of how every disease is affecting society, that simply doesn't exist. ""We don't even have a good measure of how many heart attacks there are every day,"" which would seem like a relatively easy thing to track, noted Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard University professor of epidemiology.

More comprehensive tracking is not possible with current resources and medical record-keeping, some public health advocates say.

""The fact that it is a challenge to come up with these data proves that we have underdeveloped surveillance systems in this country,"" said Jeff Levi, executive director of Trust for America's Health, a Washington-based public health research organization.

Most disease investigation and case-counting is done by state and local health departments. But quality varies state to state, and in many places it may be getting worse: State budget shortfalls and other problems led to the elimination of 7,000 health department jobs last year and 8,000 more jobs in the first six months of this year.

""You take for granted this work goes on. But it is difficult to take for granted any longer, with these cuts going on,"" said Robert Pestronk, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.

However, Pestronk and others think the government's current system of flu tracking is adequate and getting better.

The CDC has nine ways of monitoring influenza. Some focus on people who die from flu-like illness — one tracking deaths of children, another counting pneumonia and flu deaths of all ages in 122 cities.

Other systems gather flu-testing information from labs across the country. And some rely on reports of flu-like illness from hospital emergency departments and from estimates from state and territorial health officials.

Those systems combine to give a good general picture of whether more or fewer people are going to the doctor with flu, and how often lab samples are showing swine flu as compared to other respiratory bugs, health officials say.

There are problems that make even that data incomplete or inaccurate. Rapid flu tests — which are used in counting hospitalizations — are often wrong when they indicate a patient doesn't have swine flu, CDC studies have shown. In some cases, flu or swine flu was only confirmed at autopsy. But most deaths are not autopsied.

These problems are not unique to the United States. The World Health Organization also stopped counting cases in July, after deciding that tracking individual swine flu cases was too overwhelming for countries where the virus was spreading widely. The WHO has continued to update swine flu reports, but with the disclaimer that since countries are no longer required to test and report cases, WHO's numbers underestimate.

Britain also releases weekly swine flu updates, but the numbers are estimates based on how many people go to their doctors with flu-like illness, as well as calls logged to the national flu service.

Despite resource limitations and data imperfections, experts say the U.S. system is good enough to alert the experts when major changes occur in the pandemic.

""There will always be an error factor, misdiagnosis, misclassifications,"" said Pestronk, formerly the head of a county health department in Michigan. ""We'll never be at 100 percent of people getting tested. The question is what's good enough for purposes of planning and acting on the burden of disease.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna33239736
NBC,Gay Marriage ,Landmark: Supreme Court Rules Same-Sex Marriage Legal Nationwide,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday made marriage for same-sex couples legal nationwide, declaring that refusing to grant marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples violates the Constitution.

The landmark ruling will produce the most significant change in laws governing matrimony since the court struck down state bans on inter-racial marriage almost 50 years ago.

The majority opinion in the 5-4 decision was written by Justice Anthony Kennedy.

""No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were,"" Kennedy wrote. ""As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death.""

Related: Supreme Court Gay Marriage Ruling: The Highlights

Kennedy went on to speak directly to the type of criticism that often comes from conservatives in pushing back against marriage equality.

""It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves,"" Kennedy wrote. ""Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.""

A total of 36 states now permit gay couples to get married, covering roughly 70 percent of the US population. Today's ruling means the bans must end in the other 14 states — Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.

President Barack Obama, speaking from the White House just after the ruling, called the decision a ""victory for America.""

""When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free,"" the president said.

After sundown on Friday, the White House celebrated the ruling by projecting rainbow-colored lights onto the house's exterior.

Obama's own views on the matter of same-sex marriage have evolved and he has pushed increasingly for issues of gay rights in his second term.

From the White House Rose Garden, he said that social progress sometimes is slow, “and then there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.”

Those at the heart of the case said they recognized the historical significance of the decision.

“Today’s ruling affirms what millions of people across this country already know to be true in our hearts: Our love is equal” Jim Obergefell, the lead plantiff in the landmark case said outside of the Supreme Court after the ruling. “It is my hope that the term gay marriage will soon be a thing of the past. It will simply be marriage. And our nation will be better for it.”

The president called Obergefell to congratulate him shortly after the decision was announced. Obergefell took the call while he was being interviewed live on CNN.

“Your leadership on this changed the country,” Obama told him.

The decision capped a remarkably quick turnaround in public and judicial acceptance of same-sex marriage. In the past 18 months, court rulings struck down marriage bans in rapid succession — nearly 60 separate decisions in more than half the states.

Related: 'Historic Victory': Reactions to Supreme Court's Gay Marriage Ruling Pour In

Today's ruling overturned a decision from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, which said states had legitimate reasons for maintaining the traditional definition of marriage. The appeals court also said it would be better ""to allow change through the customary political processes"" instead of the courts.

Public opinion has shifted dramatically in recent years. The first Gallup poll on the subject showed only 27 percent approval for same-sex marriage in 1996. Gallup's most recent poll, taken last month, showed 60 percent approval.

Writing for the dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts said that while he recognizes that many will applaud the decision, ""for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majority's approach is deeply disheartening.""

""This universal definition of marriage as the union of a man and a woman is no historical coincidence. Marriage did not come about as a result of a political movement, discovery, disease, war, religious doctrine, or any other moving force of world history — and certainly not as a result of a prehistoric decision to exclude gays and lesbians,"" Roberts wrote. ""It arose in the nature of things to meet a vital need: ensuring that children are conceived by a mother and father committed to raising them in the stable conditions of a lifelong relationship.""

Outside of the court, people sang ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" as the decision came out.

People spilled into the street in front of the Supreme Court building and across the roadway. Initially, police asked people to move back onto the sidewalk, but eventually let them spill out into one lane in front of the court. Passing police cars honked as people cheered and waved little blue flags with yellow equal signs.

Crystal Hardin of Arlington, Va. brought her three and five-year old kids.

""I decided to come out because I've been a long time supporter of marriage equality and I brought the kids because I figured the decision would go this way and I wanted them to be here,"" Hardin said. ""I feel like in the future it will be important for them to know that they were here, we were supporting it, and you know, I don't know how they'll grow up.""

RELATED: 2016 Candidates React to Gay Marriage Ruling

The Supreme Court's decision to strike down all gay marriage bans will also force conservative Christians and Republican political leaders to make two critical decisions.

Will they acquiesce to this ruling, or continue to oppose gay marriage and fight to reverse this decision the way conservatives have battled against Roe v. Wade and abortion rights for a generation? And how they will they respond on other issues that involve the rights of lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender Americans, such as allowing gay men to lead Boy Scout troops?

Republican 2016 candidates slammed the decision, with reactions ranging from dire warnings about the future of religious liberty to calls for mutual respect.

Republican presidential candidate Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, an outspoken opponent of gay marriage, said in a lengthy statement that the decision ""will pave the way for an all out assault against the religious freedom rights of Christians who disagree with this decision.""

""The Supreme Court decision today conveniently and not surprisingly follows public opinion polls, and tramples on states' rights that were once protected by the 10th Amendment of the Constitution,"" Jindal said.

NBC,Hurricane Katrina,What went wrong in hurricane crisis?,"Looking back at it now, at the devastating destruction across the Gulf region, at one of America’s most beloved cities under water, at all the unimaginable human anguish, it’s hard to conceive that events unfolded as painfully as they did.

Just as in the aftermath of 9/11, tough questions are being asked. How much of the damage done by this catastrophic storm could have been prevented? What did the government know before Katrina hit? What went wrong? And who is accountable? ""Dateline"" talked to some of those who say Hurricane Katrina didn’t have to turn out the way it did.

Two days after hurricane Katrina struck, the Secretary of Homeland Security seemed almost self-congratulatory about the federal response to the disaster.

On August 31, 2005, Department of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff said, “We are extremely pleased with the response that every element of the federal government, all of our federal partners, have made to this terrible tragedy.”

But as the days passed, images flooded the airwaves: people stranded, lawlessness in the streets, people without food, water.

Four days after Katrina stuck, the president made his first trip to the region. As he left the White House, he acknowledged that something had gone terribly wrong with the relief effort.

He said: ""The results are not acceptable. I'm heading down there right now. We'll deploy the assets necessary to get the situation under control.""

But by the time he arrived in the area that same day, he was heaping praise on the man then running the relief effort. “Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job,” he said. “The FEMA Director is working 24 -- they're working 24 hours a day.”

But as more time passed, additional questions would be raised about just how good a job the government did.

Walter Maestri: What happened? How did this breakdown occur? You know, what led to this kind of catastrophe ?

The catastrophe of Katrina may have come as a shock to most Americans, but it should have been no surprise at all to many officials in local, state and federal government.

A prophetic newspaper series

Marc Schleifstein, a reporter for the New Orleans Times-Picayune, says the danger New Orleans was in wasn’t a secret.

In June 2002, he co-authored what can only be called a prophetic five-part front page series warning that a direct hit on New Orleans by a major hurricane was inevitable.

Stone Phillips: Your words three years ago: ""Thousands will drown trapped in homes or cars by rising water. Others will be washed away or crushed by debris. Survivors will end up trapped on roofs, in buildings or on high ground surrounded by water with no means of escape and little food or fresh water perhaps for several days.” I mean, that’s just a part of what you wrote. It sounds exactly like what happened.

Mark Schleifstein, reporter for New Orleans Times-Picayune: It is what happened. And we knew it—we knew that was going happen.

That’s because hurricanes have battered New Orleans and other towns along the Gulf of Mexico forever. Before Katrina, there were a dozen deadly hurricanes stretching back over a hundred years—to a time when they couldn’t be predicted and didn’t have names.

When hurricanes weren’t devastating the region, floods were.

The great flood of 1927 displaced more than 300,000 people—many of them ending up in tent cities.

In fact, the threat of hurricanes and flooding was so severe that as far back as the 1700s private landowners began to build a system of levees to protect New Orleans. Because what was obvious back then, and what we’ve seen again these past ten days, is that New Orleans is uniquely vulnerable to flooding.

Schleifstein: It’s a bowl. And it’s so low—my house is eight feet below sea level behind that levee. So once water tops the levees, you’re filling a bowl. And the more water that pours in, the more water, the higher it gets. And you can’t get the water out.

Recognizing that threat, in the 1960s, the federal government spent millions around New Orleans to greatly expand the levee system. The goal: to make sure the levees could withstand a major hurricane and hold back the water surge that might accompany it.

One way or another the city survived every major hurricane that came its way: Betsy in 1965, Camille in 1969, and Ivan just last year.

Forecasters' growing alarm

Two weeks ago, as Hurricane Katrina approached the Gulf coast, forecasters became increasingly alarmed that Katrina was growing into a monster unlike almost any other storm they’d seen before.

Billy Wagner: There's gonna be a tremendous amount of damage. It's a big system. It's a lot bigger than Camille was.

That was the scene inside the National Hurricane Center in Miami as the storm approached.

The experts in Miami weren’t the only ones worried about Katrina. At the same time, in Baton Rouge, another hurricane expert, Ivor van Heerden of Louisiana State University, was running computer models to predict the possible damage. It was looking really bad to him too.

Ivor van Heerden, hurricane expert: On Saturday evening, we put out our first storm search model output that showed the city was going to flood.Phillips: On Saturday night?Van Heerden: Saturday night. And we sent out an e-mail to federal agencies, to the state agencies. Phillips: So, your model said even on its track Saturday night that a storm surge could lead to flooding in the city of New Orleans.Van Heerden: Yes.

He sent the e-mail to the Hurricane Center in Miami. There, Max Mayfield, the director, had already issued a public alert, warning this could be the big one.

Max Mayfield, director of hurricane center in Miami: And—you know, we—kept emphasizing that the potential for large loss of life was there. And our headline said, “Potentially Catastrophic Hurricane Katrina.” So that is really hard to let go of loss of life.

He was so concerned he did something he rarely ever does. He called everyone he could think of who could help get the word out. Among them was New Orleans newspaper reporter Mark Schleifstein.

Schleifstein: He said, “Mark, how high is your building and what’s its structural integrity?” And I knew at that point that we were gonna get hit.

He also called Walter Maestri, one of the top emergency relief officials in the New Orleans area.

Walter Maestri, New Orleans relief official: And he said, “Walter, let me tell you right now, I think it’s coming to you. Be prepared.” I said, “Max, are you sure?” He said, “I’m as sure as I can be.” And I can tell you, Max Mayfield’s not a person who does that lightly.

And he didn’t stop there.

Mayfield: And I did call the Louisiana and Mississippi governors. And Mayor Nagin in New Orleans, just to tell them that this is—the real thing. I wanted to be sure that I had done everything that I could do to—you know, let people know how serious this was.

On Sunday, as the storm picked up speed, Mayfield even briefed President Bush via video conference.

The president had already declared a state of emergency. And the mayor of New Orleans who had urged people to leave the city voluntarily, now made evacuation mandatory.

New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin said, “We are facing a storm that most of us have feared I do want to create panic, but I do want people to understand that this is of the highest nature.”

The next day, Monday, Katrina came ashore. And early indications were that the city once again had dodged a bullet. But this time the Big Easy had run out of luck.

And the people of New Orleans were about to pay dearly for years of government inaction.

Van Heerden: I hope they apologize to everyone of those people who’ve died unnecessarily because there are thousands, in my opinion, who have died unnecessarily.

When Katrina came ashore, Mississippi took a direct hit and communities all along the Gulf Coast were wiped out. But it seemed New Orleans had been spared the worst. The city was not under water. It looked as if the levees had held.

On August 29, Monday night, NBC’s Carl Quintanilla was reporting that onlookers were back in the French Quareter. “In the words of one, the fact that the damage wasn’t worse was 'pure New Orleans luck,'” quoted Quintanilla.

But that night everything changed. The storm surge had breeched the levees and floodwalls.

Hurricane expert Ivor van Heerden got a frightening phone call.

Van Heerden: At eight o’clock, the hammer dropped. Somebody came to us at the LSU desk and said that there’s a nursing home and they’ve just phoned in. The water was rising half a foot an hour at the nursing home. Phillips: When you realized the levees had failed, what did you think?Van Heerden: My God, it’s night time. The water’s going to rise slowly, quietly and the next thing, they’re going to climb out of their beds and step in water. And the panic’s gonna go in. So what do a lot of them do? They were possible forced up the attic. You know, I just had the worst chill.Phillips: A slow, quiet—Van Heerden: Filling at night.Phillips: Killer.Van Heerden: Imagine the chill that went through those people.

The following morning it became the city was rapidly filling with water.

The next morning, on NBC’s ""Today"" show, Brian Williams called it a disaster. It was dry the night before, he said.

Not just a couple of feet of water where Brian Williams was standing in the historic French Quarter, but up to 20 feet of water in other parts of the city, submerging entire neighborhoods, and threatening the survival of the city.

Warnings about leeves

What hasn’t been widely known until now is that over the years many local state and federal government officials had been warned over and over again about this very scenario.

This week, Walter Maestri, Director of Emergency Management in Jefferson Parish just outside the city of New Orleans, told us he couldn’t help but remember the meeting he and other Louisiana officials had four years ago with the then-director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Maestri: And he told us, he said, “Look, you guys are the number one community in the United States to be adversely affected by a land-falling hurricane.”Phillips: Number one?Maestri: Number one. And he knew it.

Others say it was common knowledge among emergency planners that the levees built to protect the city might not even do what they were designed to do 40 years ago. That is, protect the city from a Category Three hurricane.

Schleifstein: The levee systems were built to withstand a Category Three hurricane. And the federal officials, at all levels, have become nervous about the levee system that exists today because it no longer will withstand a three and they know that. Phillips: Wait—wait a minute. I mean, generally we’ve been hearing that this levee system could withstand a Category Three hurricane. You’re saying officials knew that it might not?Schleifstein: Yeah.Phillips: A three, even a two could have been a problem?Schleifstein: Even a two would be a problem for certain areas.

That's partly because, over the years, New Orleans has sunk even further, and the wetlands that serve as a natural protective buffer have been diminished by commercial development and rising water levels. And what about those aging levees and floodwalls?

So if the levees were so deficient, why you might wonder didn’t the federal government do more to improve them.

In fact, over the last few years, the Army Corps of Engineers - which repairs and inspects the levees - asked for millions of dollars to improve flood protection, but Congress gave the Corps much less than it asked for.

Al Naomi of the Army Corps of Engineers oversees the levees. He says it would actually require billions to build levees strong enough to withstand a storm like Katrina. And he says there wasn’t time anyway.

Al Naomi, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: It would have taken a good 20 years of preparation and construction to make this city stormproof for a Category 5 storm. It would have been too late.

So officials knew that some day the levees might fail. And it turns out they were warned just last year how catastrophic a levee failure would be.

'Hurricane Pam' drill

In July of 2004, FEMA sponsored what amounted to a hurricane ""war game."" It anticipated what could happen if a hypothetical category three storm named Pam hit New Orleans. LSU hurricane expert Ivor van Heerden was one of the organizers.

Van Heerden: It showed that there was going to be potentially 300,000 people to be rescued, some pretty serious public health issues. And that we were going to have to find alternative housing for about 800,000 people.Phillips: So a huge public health and safety crisis on your hands?Van Heerden: Exactly.

Despite the dire predictions, Van Heerden says some federal officials didn’t seem to take the drill seriously.

Van Heerden: I definitely felt that some of them thought I was an academic geek. And, you know, they scoffed at us.

There were some folks from the Corps of Engineers who were actually kind of laughing at this.

Phillips: Laughing at—at—Van Heerden: “This is an impossibility. This is not gonna happen.”Phillips: Dismissing it?Vanheerden: That’s right.

And he says, a representative from FEMA even objected when Van Heerden, who was born in South Africa, recommended buying tents to shelter the hundreds of thousands of evacuees expected in a real future hurricane.

Van Heerden: And her response to me was -- Americans don’t live in tents.Phillips: This was a FEMA official?Vanheerden: That’s right.Phillips: Americans don’t live in tents.Van Heerden: Yeah, obviously because I have an accent, she thought I didn’t understand the American way of life. It hurts. You know, I should have grabbed her, shook her by the shoulders, you know? Showed her some video of other refugee situations.Phillips: Think she regrets those words today?Vanheerden: I bet she does.

Vanheerden told us he gave a CD containing his Hurricane Pam presentation warning of a potential catastrophe to local, state and federal officials -- from FEMA, the U.S. military, and the White House.

Emergency Management Director Walter Maestri participated in the same drill.

Phillips: Federal officials have suggested that this storm and all of this—all that’s happened, just could not have been anticipated. What do you say to that?Maestri: I tell them to read the report that they paid for from the exercise that they financed and managed. And tell me that they couldn’t anticipate it. Because Stone, I can tell you right now, everything that’s happened is in that report. Every detail is in that report.

But the Hurricane Pam Report was not widely distributed to the public and few citizens heard about the catastrophic losses it foretold.

Louisiana officials did make an effort to teach citizens what to do if the city ever flooded. The state funded a video, obtained by Dateline. But it never got to the citizens of New Orleans. In a cruel irony, the tape was supposed to be released this month.

Had New Orleans residents actually seen it prior to Katrina, they would have heard their mayor, Ray Nagin say:

""The main thing is everyone needs to make their own plans. Check with your neighbors. Check with your relatives. Car pool. And make sure that you have a way to go out,"" he said on the tape.

But when the storm hit, thousands of people had no plans and no way out.

Hours after the city started filling with water, the nation watched in astonishment as New Orleans began to drown.

People really were on their own as they struggled to survive.

There were heroic rescues, but there was little food and no clean water, sanitation, electricity, or phone service.

The city was rapidly sinking into chaos. Order had broken down. Looters roamed freely, some to survive, some to steal.

Everyone was watching in disbelief as one nightmarish scene played out after another. And soon, everyone was asking: how could it possibly have come to this? How could the most powerful nation on earth fail so badly in protecting and rescuing its own people?

The first sign of mismanagement



Perhaps the first sign that the management of this disaster was about to become a disaster of its own came even before Katrina hit.

There was an evacuation plan posted on the city Web site promising that “The City of New Orleans will utilize all available resources to quickly and safely evacuate threatened areas.”

But the plan apparently existed only on paper.

The city itself had said it would take at least 72 hours to get everyone out of New Orleans, but Mayor Ray Nagin did not call for a mandatory evacuation until Sunday, less than 24 hours before Katrina barreled into the coastline. And once he did, there was a mad scramble to get out of town—bumper to bumper traffic reported for up to 180 miles.

It was slow going but 80 percent of the city's residents did get out. Still, just as the city's own plan anticipated up to 100,000 residents were left behind.

The city planned to bus as many of them as possible to a shelter of last resort -- the Superdome. But when the time came, many of them couldn't get there.

One picture makes you wonder how much more the city had might've done: Dozens and dozens of buses under water. Had they been moved to higher ground, perhaps they could have gotten people out and supplies in.

Those who did make it to the Superdome would soon find themselves living in shockingly squalid conditions.

The situation might not have spiraled out of control if the state and federal governments had moved more quickly and efficiently.

Maestri: The state is supposed to be a principal coordinating agency between the locals and the feds. And that was a tremendous breakdown there, it didn’t happen.

The state has also been criticized for not moving enough national guardsmen in soon enough to evacuate so many people who so desperately needed help.

Louisiana’s Republican Senator David Vitter has been critical of the state’s Democratic Governor Kathleen Blanco.

Sen. David Vitter: Now that was the governor's call. In terms of the National Guard and getting National Guard troops in. Now, personally, I think that took too long.

Was it a federal failure?

But many independent experts say the greatest failures were at the federal level.

Jane Bullock, former FEMA senior official: I don’t believe this disaster is about failed evacuation. I think this disaster is about a failed system and failed leadership at the federal level.

Jane Bullock is a former senior official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. She was a career civil servant, promoted to her senior position by the Clinton administration. She says the miscalculations began before Katrina made landfall and were made not just by the city and state. Though FEMA says it prepared for the storm, Jane Bullock says federal efforts fell short.

Bullock: My biggest surprise was the fact that they hadn’t pre-deployed more assets: military assets, food, water, supplies, medical, before the hurricane struck. Because they knew it was coming. And I think, if they had pre-deployed those assets; lives would’ve been saved.Phillips: You ordered an evacuation, but what was mobilized? I mean were national guard troops in position. Were helicopters standing by? Were buses ready to take people away?Nagin: No. None of that.Phillips: None of that?Nagin: None of that.Phillips: None of that?Nagin: None of that.Phillips: Why is that?Nagin: I dont know that is question for somebody else. All I can do is that I was dealing with it as a mayor -- how do I prepare my city for an incredibly powerful storm so immediately we tried to get as many people out as possible.

By declaring a state of emergency in Louisiana and Mississippi two days before the levees failed and flooding began, the president had given FEMA the green light to move in.

Bullock: Once the President declares the disaster, FEMA is in charge, working in coordination with state and local governments.

The day before the storm hit FEMA director Mike Brown—whose lack of experience later came into question—promised that the federal government would be there to help.

On that day, Brown said, “FEMA is not going to hesitate at all in this storm. We are not going to sit back and make this a bureaucratic process. We’re gonna move fast, we’re gonna move quick and we’re gonna do whatever it takes to help these disaster victims.”

But we know now federal aid did not come quickly. Sometimes it didn’t come at all.

Bullock: Nobody pulled the trigger on the resources. The director of FEMA didn’t pull the trigger. The Department of Homeland Security didn’t pull the trigger. The resources simply didn’t get there.

And it wasn’t always clear whether it was the state or federal government that was to blame. Is it possible state officials bear some of the responsibility because they didn’t know how to get the help they needed?

Phillips: Governor Blanco’s office said we wanted troops and we wanted choppers and we wanted food and water. And FEMA wanted an organizational chart. Did this deteriorate into a turf battle?Nagin: Yes — in my opinion absolutely. Who is responsible? Who has the ultimate call? How do things move quickly and at the end of the day - it may be a struggle over money. And I think it is a dog-gone shame because people suffered and they didn’t have to suffer.

And maybe they didn’t have to die.

Jack Stephens, Sherriff of St. Bernard Parish: We’ve seen people die in front of our eyes because they didn’t have adequate water and adequate medicine. It was like a scene from Exodus. No one can blame somebody else for an act of God. But the federal response to this disaster cost people lives. Their delinquency in getting just the fundamental things that it takes to stay alive, just water and medicine, just a little bit of food down here, cost people their lives.

An unintended consequence of the war on terror also slowed the relief effort. Because of new anti-terror safeguards put in place after 9/11, volunteers from other states, who wanted to bring help and supplies into the gulf region, say they first had to be cleared into the hurricane zone by FEMA.

Sheriff Dennis Randle from Carroll county, Indiana says he had men ready to roll south, but they were told to wait.

Dennis Randle, sheriff from Carroll County Indiana: We had to fax off all the officers that were coming down here -- their names and what they did for the department. We had to get our paperwork through our state FEMA. Indiana hadn’t gotten the request for help yet. That’s what we were being told. Watching the news and watching the mayor, it was pretty clear that he needed help.

Even this Animal Rescue League worker was forced to get FEMA’s okay to come in and save stranded pets.

Nicholas Gilman: This is really frustrating. We’ve got the resources, we’ve got the people. And it is frustrating not to be able to get to work.

And there have been many reports that help was actually turned away by FEMA because the agency had not approved the delivery.

And then there was this story that we found equally hard to fathom — a medical assessment team capable of treating hundreds of patients a day— was sent by FEMA from Alabama to Mississippi and then on to Texas. Over 11 days, they say they ended up treating one person for a small cut. Yesterday, they were moved yet again.

Just days after the city flooded, New Orleans had deteriorated into chaos. Thousands were stranded in their homes by high water, with only a small band of Coast Guard rescuers and local first responders going house to house to try to save them.

The Superdome and convention center were ground zero for the hell that had become New Orleans. People there were angry and desperate.

NBC Cameraman Tony Zumbado was on TV showing pictures of angry citizens at the Convention Center. “I can’t put into words the amount of destruction that is in this city and how these people are coping they are just left behind there is nothing offered to them.”

They were also afraid. Fear and lawlessness seemed to rule the streets, overwhelming the police. Hundreds of officers didn’t show up for work, many possibly choosing to stay with their families to help them survive — two officers committed suicide.

Just who was in charge?

There were some Louisiana National Guardsmen in New Orleans—but not enough to restore order or to distribute supplies to a starving city.

Walter Maestri: All of the destruction that’s the result of civil disorder could have been avoided if we would have had the resources would have been available to feed hungry people, to give hungry people food and water and formula for the infants.

Walter Maestri, Emergency Management Director of for Jefferson Parish, says federal help of any kind was late in coming.

Phillips: When did the first federal presence really show up?Maestri: For approximately six days we sat here waiting.Phillips: Nearly a week?Maestri: Nearly a week.Phillips: Were you prepared?Maestri: We had done what FEMA told us to be prepared for. We were ready to sustain ourselves for 48 to 60 hours. And we did that, we did that. We were basically told to hang on by our fingernails for those 60 hours or so and we’ll be there, we’ll come and get you. It didn’t happen. Phillips: Did the federal government fail this city?Maestri: They certainly weren’t here, let me put it that way. What happened was the cavalry didn't show up.

That wasn’t true everywhere. The cavalry did arrive in St. Bernard Parish, but it wasn’t the U.S. Cavalry, according to the sheriff there.

Pohlman: The Royal Canadian Mounted Police sent a large contingent.

As it turns out, the Canadians Pohlman met weren't the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. They were actually a search and rescue team that had traveled all the way from Vancouver, British Columbia, some 2,800 miles away, and they got there first.

Pohlman: I don't know how they got here. It may have been on their horses, but they got here.

FEMA crosses wires with local officials

FEMA teams eventually did arrive in stricken areas. But at least initially, in their efforts to organize an effective relief effort, the FEMA workers sometimes crossed wires with local officials. Maestri told us FEMA workers seized diesel fuel needed to run generators for emergency response.

Maestri: When we went to get the fuel, fuel that we had ordered and paid for, bought by Jefferson Parish, that fuel was seized. And we were told that FEMA had taken control of all fuel. And they were seizing that. And we would have to justify— go through a bureaucratic process to get that fuel released to the parish.Phillips: So your people were turned around?Maestri: Well, we were turned around and we came to realize that if that’s the kind of game that’s being played, when I sent the fuel truck back and I sent it back with armed sheriff’s deputies, because not on my watch. I was gonna try to make sure that nobody died.Phillips: A nd they get the fuel?Maestri: We got the fuel that time.Phillips: So you were saying that FEMA actually became an obstruction—Maestri: That’s correct.

And when his radio communications system was crippled Maestri says he was stunned to learn FEMA was responsible.

Maestri: My technicians reported back to me, “Hey, I know why you’re not communicating. Somebody took down your all antenna.” When we got him up there and he looked he said, “My God.” He said, “This is a FEMA antenna. Somebody disconnected your antenna and put theirs up.”

The federal response drew criticism throughout the Gulf region, not just in Louisiana. Four days after the storm, we spoke with these Mississippi fire and rescue officers who said the federal government was missing in action. Their neighbors were a lot more helpful then FEMA.

One said: “The state of Florida and Alabama just the cities themselves that have come together, Pensacola, Pensacola, have come together to send us, everything you see back here, all this food, all donated by cities.”

Where was FEMA when the people of the Gulf needed it?

Reorganizing FEMA with Homeland Security

Jane Bullock spent 21 years at FEMA, and she says there are reasons the agency didn’t perform better. After 9/11, FEMA was folded into the Department of Homeland Security. That, she says, was a big mistake with serious consequences.

Bullock: FEMA consistently lost resources to other parts of the Department of Homeland Security that were higher priorities. At the State and local level they were told 75 percent of their time had to be spent on terrorism. I think the results are what we’re seeing. Maestri: The emphasis now is on Homeland Security. And we certainly understand that. You know the money is going to prepare us for an attack against terrorists. But Max Mayfield, the Director of the National Hurricane Center, I think put it most succinctly in an address he gave recently when he said, “You know we can’t be sure when and if a terrorist attack is going to come. But we do know that land falling hurricanes are going to come every year.”

Bullock says something else contributed to what many describe as the agency’s poor performance. The changes at FEMA in recent years, she says, have resulted in hundreds of experienced disaster relief professionals leaving the agency.

Phillips: What went wrong? Maestri: I don’t know. As I told you earlier, I'm dismayed at what happened. When the delivery doesn’t happen, when the promises aren’t kept, that’s when a catastrophe becomes even greater. It’s compounded.

'Everyone failed'

The federal government isn’t alone in taking heat for what happened after Katrina hit.

Phillips: How would you rate the state’s performance?Maestri: I think the state’s, you know the state’s performance would be rated as a C plus.Bullock: The National Guard is traditionally an asset that the governor uses. I was surprised that the guard in Louisiana wasn’t activated earlier. I think that things would have been dramatically different if the Guard had been mobilized earlier.

And what of the New Orleans mayor who was quick to blame the federal authorities?

Phillips: Who failed these people?Nagin: Everybody, everybody. Phillips: Yourself included?Nagin: I could have done things better.Phillips: What would you have done differently?Nagin: Scream louder ... I should have screamed louder.

As the water begins recede, the question remains, what next? How do you rebuild an entire city? There will be other storms. How do we prevent them from doing this kind of damage again? And what changes will have to be made on local, state and federal agencies so that the break downs that happened here never happen again

It may take years to fully understand what went wrong—and just as long to figure out how to correct the problems. But some of the people involved in the tragedy of New Orleans have already begun to think about ways to prevent another Katrina.

At the head of the list is Mayor Ray Nagin.

Nagin: I’ll put it to you this way. This process has probably taught the nation what not to do. It is bigger than one agency. It’s bigger than one person, or two people or whatever. We have a system of responding to disasters that is designed way back--that is not modern enough to deal with what we are dealing with. There is no organizational structure -- no clear lines of authority.

Major James Pohlman, of the St. Bernard Parish Sheriff’s Department thinks a good start would be to upgrade communication lines.

Pohlman: You can’t tell me that somehow, someway, they can’t deliver some type of communication system and set it up on the levee system, the driest area you can find and say, okay we’re here, what do you need? And radio that out and get the resources in. I think we could have had bigger resources in the beginning if we’d had better communications.

The head of the National Hurricane Center has this advice:

Mayfield: We’ve said for years that the battle against a hurricane is won not during the hurricane season but outside the season. And we’ve always urged, you know, individuals and families an businesses and communities to develop their own hurricane plan. They need to have that plan in place before the hurricane season gets here.

And when New Orleans finally rebuilds, will there be a way to ultimately protect the city if there is another storm like Katrina?

NBC,Trump Elected,Trump just won the White House: Here's how he did it,"Here's what's happening now — with projections from NBC News:

Clinton has reportedly called Trump to concede, and NBC has projected the election will go to Trump.

New Hampshire, Michigan and Arizona are all too close to call.

Trump is projected to win key battlegrounds Ohio and North Carolina.

He was the apparent winner in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, NBC reported.

The GOP nominee is also the apparent winner in Florida, according to NBC News.

Trump is also the projected winner in Utah, a state that featured a relatively close three-way race.

Clinton is the projected winner in Nevada, Maine and Virginia.

Trump was the projected winner in several states he had been expected to win: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Iowa, Idaho, Indiana, West Virginia, South Carolina, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wyoming, Louisiana and Kentucky.

Clinton is the projected winner in several states she had been expected to win: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Oregon, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. She is also projected to win in D.C.

As expected, the Republicans are projected to maintain control of the House.

When Trump appeared to be outperforming most analysts' expectations on Tuesday night, Dow futures fell more than 800 points at one point. After he declared victory, Dow futures were down less than 300 points.

NBC,Brett Kavanaugh picked for SCJ,Who is Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh?,"President Donald Trump's Supreme Court pick is no stranger to partisan politics: Before becoming a judge, he was helping make the case for the impeachment of Bill Clinton and later for the election of George W. Bush.

Twenty years ago, Kavanaugh's story starts amid the highly politicized independent counsel investigation into Clinton. He worked for Starr as a young Yale Law graduate, first when Kenneth Starr was solicitor general and later in the Office of the Independent Counsel, where Kavanaugh was a key player in the slew of investigations into the Clintons, including the Whitewater scandal, the suicide of White House counsel Vincent Foster and Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.

The Starr Report to Congress laid out the details of Clinton and Lewinsky's affair and findings of potential wrongdoing by the president. Kavanaugh was the primary author of the section on the grounds for possible impeachment, Starr would reportedly later say, because ""that needed to be very carefully crafted, so I was looking to one of the office's most talented lawyers — of superb and balanced judgment — to take the lead in drafting.""

Kavanaugh's involvement in politics didn't end there.

He was a member of the GOP legal team fighting to stop the recount in Florida to clear the way for Bush's election against Al Gore in 2000, later taking a job in the Bush White House in 2001, where he'd serve for five years as counsel and later staff secretary until his confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2006.

Democrats aggressively opposed his nomination — made in 2003 but dragged out for several years — with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., calling Kavanaugh a ""political foot soldier"" during the confirmation proceedings.

Kavanaugh's views about investigations of a sitting president have drawn renewed attention with his nomination, given the special counsel probe into Trump.

""Looking back to the late 1990s, for example, the nation certainly would have been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots,"" he wrote in a 2009 article in the Minnesota Law Review that suggested presidents be exempt from criminal investigations and civil suits while in office.

The point, he argued, is not to elevate the president above the law ""but simply to defer litigation and investigations until the president is out of office"" and let Congress police the president — with impeachment, if necessary — while they are in office.

Kavanaugh is a practicing Catholic, which he noted in his remarks at the White House on Monday night. Accepting his nomination in the East Room, he stressed public service and volunteering during his address to the nation.

""The motto of my Jesuit high school was 'men for others,'"" he said. ""I've tried to live that creed.""

He met his wife, Ashley, while working in the White House in 2001; she was the president's personal secretary and now works as town manager of Chevy Chase Village, Maryland, where they live. Their first date was the day before the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, and they raced out of the White House together during the attacks.

""Through bad days, and so many better days, she's been a great wife and an inspiring mom,"" he said.

The couple have two young daughters.

""Margaret loves sports and she loves to read; Liza loves sports and she loves to talk,"" Kavanaugh said to laughs as he introduced his children on live television at the White House. ""I have tried to create bonds with my daughters like my father created with me.""

He is both a sports fan and a girls basketball coach; the students call him ""Coach K,"" he said. He's run the Boston Marathon twice.

Kavanaugh also teaches at Harvard Law School — he noted that he was hired by now-Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, when she worked as the dean at the school — and he tutors students, too.

He is the only child of two attorneys. His father went to law school at night while working full time. His mother, Martha, was a public school teacher in the 1960s and 1970s in Washington. She went to law school when he was 10, and became a prosecutor and later the first Judge Kavanaugh in the family when she joined the Maryland state bench in 1993.

""My introduction to law came at our dinner table, when she practiced her closing arguments. Her trademark line was, 'Use your common sense; what rings true, what rings false.'

NBC,Area 51 Raid,Storming Area 51 on September 20? Here's why you're unlikely to find aliens hiding in the desert,"More than a million people say — at least online — they want to scale the fences and storm Area 51, a top-secret Air Force installation in the Nevada desert. Their stated hope is to see the aliens who for decades have been rumored to be warehoused within. The blitz is scheduled for Sept. 20, so mark your calendars.

Or not.

The idea for this effort was birthed on Facebook, and it was clearly intended as a joke. But so was Johnny Carson’s 1973 claim that the U.S. was running out of toilet paper — an offhand attempt at humor that triggered a real shortage. So joke or no, the hordes might really show up at the closely guarded federal facility, a poor decision according to authorities. BookMaker, an Internet betting site, is already weighing the odds of a tsunami of citizens storming the chain-links and, if they do, the chances that they’ll find any aliens mothballed inside.

It’s all good fun (unless, perhaps, you’re in charge of security for the Air Force.) But should you go?

It’s all good fun (unless, perhaps, you’re in charge of security for the Air Force.) But should you go? And, really, is there any reason to believe that extraterrestrials are stacked up at Area 51?

The search for extraterrestrial life has long been a fixture of American pop culture, immortalized in television shows like “The X-Files” and movies such as “E.T.,” “Independence Day” and “Arrival” among many others. These examples speak to a widespread sentiment that has long bubbled beneath the surface. But lately, it seems like the conspiracy theorists have been getting a little bit louder. The media has devoted a lot of space to speculation about various space objects, for example, with reporters and scientists alike wondering if, for example, the mysterious object 'Oumuamua was an asteroid, a comet — “or an alien spaceship.”

Which brings us back to Area 51. The Air Force says a citizen assault would be “dangerous” — a description perfectly chosen to encourage those who believe that what goes on at this hush-hush base is both suspect and probably malevolent. Signs posted around Area 51 somberly note that trespassing will be dealt with harshly, and that deadly force is authorized — as if you’d care whether or not it’s authorized when they winch your body out of the sagebrush.

Of course, secret things do go on at Area 51 — the testing of new military aircraft, for instance. The Air Force is not keen on people taking photos. So trying to scale the Area 51’s ramparts is about as advisable as storming Fort Knox. And even if camo-clad guards aren’t enough to dissuade you, there’s always the desert itself. Daytime temperatures, even in late September, hover around a sweaty 90 degrees. Refreshments will be hard to find, and the expected crush of people will more or less guarantee you’ll be sleeping in your car or under a creosote bush.

OK, but maybe you’re thinking that revealing humanity’s contact with aliens would be worth the discomfort. Which, indeed, it would. And internet jests aside, a lot of people in the so-called UFO community seem convinced that the federal government really keeps evidence of extraterrestrial visitors — dead or alive — somewhere. Surveys show that one-third of the American public is convinced that aliens are visiting Earth, and a majority say that the government keeps information about these beings secret.

However, crashed saucers or broken bodies aren’t on display at the Smithsonian or Roswell’s UFO Museum. This lack of obvious evidence encourages true believers to claim that federal authorities are the only people with the technological capabilities to gather alien artifacts. And of all the places they could squirrel away this evidence, they’ve chosen southern Nevada.

Frankly, this is a poor argument. Wayfaring aliens are unlike new missiles or Mach 3 fighter jets. Alien spacecraft would, one presumes, be routinely noticed by many of the billions of people who are not employed by the U.S. military, nearly all of whom have cellphones with cameras. Sure, the recently released videos made by some Navy pilots are suggestively mysterious. But they’re also ambiguous. And what about the around 100,000 commercial flights that take off every day, apparently without the slightest concern with — or notice of — extraterrestrial craft? Does the International Airline Pilots Association offer training on how to deal with aliens in our airspace?

It beggars belief to think that the many, many employees and contractors who’ve worked at Area 51 in the seven decades since the celebrated Roswell incident have been capable of keeping news of stockpiled aliens under wraps.

Perhaps most importantly, however, is the fact that humans are weak and susceptible to all sorts of pressure and enticements. It beggars belief to think that the many, many employees and contractors who’ve worked at Area 51 in the seven decades since the celebrated Roswell incident have been capable of keeping news of stockpiled aliens under wraps, despite the fact that it would be the biggest story ever. The oft-repeated argument that secrecy is necessary in order to avoid panicking the populace doesn’t wash. Folks already believe E.T. is here, and they still go to the office every morning.

If nothing else, the suggested blitz of Area 51 demonstrates Nevada’s continuing success in cornering the alien market. In 1996, state officials christened route 375 as the Extraterrestrial Highway. This 100-mile stretch of straightaway, which parallels the northern border of Area 51, might have qualified as the world’s most boring two-hour drive if it weren’t for the fact that some people have seen strange objects in the sky while en route.

It’s also noteworthy that the Nevada Commission on Tourism, which promoted the highway rebranding, didn’t point to the fact that, three years earlier, state Sen. Richard Bryan had introduced an amendment to cancel the NASA project to search for radio signals from extraterrestrial intelligence. But then again, those aliens would have been light-years away and of little benefit to the Nevada economy.

As for Area 51, the truth may not be out there. But some high-speed aircraft and a lot of prickly pear probably are.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/storming-area-51-september-20-here-s-why-you-re-ncna1034781
NBC,Russia Invades Ukraine,What Invasion? Russian Denials on Crimea Trigger War of Words,"As pro-Russian forces consolidate their control of Ukraine's Crimea, occupying and surrounding military bases and a key ferry terminal, a war of words has broken out over Moscow's denials that its military was involved.

American officials have brushed off Russia's remarks almost incredulously, yet the Kremlin has stuck to its line that no active-duty Russian personnel were part of the apparent takeover of Crimea over the weekend.

""No, absolutely no (Russian troops),"" Vladimir Putin's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared on Wednesday when asked whether his forces were involved.

When questioned about the Tiger and Rys armored personnel carriers seen throughout the strategic peninsula – vehicles used only by the militaries of the United Arab Emirates and Russia – Shoigu said he had “no idea” where they were coming from. Agence France-Presse reported that Shoigu also dismissed photographs military vehicles with Russian license plates in Crimea as a ""provocation"" and ""nonsense.""

Most of Crimea’s 2 million inhabitants speak Russian, and many describe themselves as Russian - even if they hold Ukrainian passports. Crimea is also home to a Russian naval base on the Black Sea.

In the West, Russia's denials that their troops were effectively in control of Crimea have prompted disbelief.

Secretary of State John Kerry smiled and shook his head when NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell repeated Russian President Vladimir Putin’s claims that none of his troops were involved.

“He really denied there were troops in Crimea?” he asked during a press conference on Tuesday.

Kerry's Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov has stuck to a similar line to Shoigu in the wake of protests which overthrew pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych last month.

""As for the military personnel of the Black Sea fleet, they’re in their deployment sites,” Lavrov said in response to a journalist’s question during a trip to Spain on Wednesday.

Under a deal due to expire in 2042, Russia had the right to billet up to 25,000 military personnel in the Crimea. But the agreement does not allow for Russian troops to effectively take control of the region.

So who has surrounded government buildings, bases and Ukrainian forces? Militias made up of pro-Russian civilians, Moscow contends.

""If you mean the self-defense units created by the inhabitants of Crimea, we give them no orders, they take no orders from us,” Lavrov said on Wednesday.

""It makes sense in the universe where Vladimir Putin lives ... His media says there are no Russian troops (and) he tries to export his media model to the outer world.”

While the Russian soldiers were in plain view on the streets of Simferopol and other cities after the incursion in Crimea, they are now being kept inside and out of site, several members of self-defense units in the region told NBC News. They have left the work of patrolling the streets to these local citizen guards over the past two days.

Late Wednesday, Crimea's new leader repeated claims that Russian troops were not actually in charge of the peninsula. He insisted it was under the control of riot police and security forces joined by about 11,000 ""self-defense"" troops.

Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said that Shoigu told him that the armed men taking control in Crimea were “were well-trained militia forces responding to threats to ethnic Russians in the Crimea.""

Dempsey added that his ""military judgment is that these are soldiers who have been taken out of their traditional uniforms and re-purposed for placement in the Crimea as a militia force.""

Indeed, the Pentagon says it was aware that Russian forces began flowing into Crimea late last week. On Friday, Ukraine's interior minister accused Moscow of a ""military invasion and occupation"" after troops allegedly blockaded an airport near a Russian naval base and armed men seized another airport.

Journalists and residents have seen men in military uniforms, minus Russian military badges, traveling the countryside and beyond bases and in military vehicles using Russian license plates.

Some have admitted that they’re Russian military, not members of the self-defense militias.

In one video posted on YouTube, a uniformed man is asked: “Are you Ukrainian [citizens] or Russian?”

""Russian military servicemen,"" he responds.

While insisting that no Russian forces were involved in the occupation, Putin has also said that many of his troops knew their Ukrainian counterparts personally, and he was ""certain"" that Ukrainian and Russian forces would be ""on the same side of the barricade.""

So what’s behind the East-West dissonance?

“It makes sense in the universe where Vladimir Putin lives,” said Dr. Igor Sutyagin, an expert in U.S.-Russian relations and nuclear arms control with London-based defense and security think tank RUSI. “His media says there are no Russian troops (and) he tries to export his media model to the outer world.”

Putin likely believes that Russia’s takeover in Crimea will work because the West won't act decisively against him, despite the evidence that Russia has invaded another country in the “heart of Europe,” Sutyagin said.

“Putin is winning over Ukraine – what will force him to leave Crimea? Effectively nothing,” he said.

NBC,Trump Inauguration,Trump Inauguration: What the World Is Saying About New President,"As Donald Trump is inaugurated as 45th president of the United States, NBC News takes a glance at what people around the planet — from world leaders to ordinary citizens — are saying about America's new leader.

Russia

Around 4,800 miles from Washington, D.C., a Donald Trump inauguration party was in full swing.

On the eve of Trump being sworn into office, around 180 partygoers at a jazz club in downtown Moscow were being entertained by a group named The Trump Band and well-known Russian-American singer Willi Tokarev, who has just released an album named ""Trumplissimo America.""

Tokarev, who is 82, praised the incoming leader as an ""unbelievable superman, the symbol of America.""

""It's no secret the Russians are welcoming Trump's victory,"" Igor Khaletsky, the owner of the Arbat 13 club, told NBC News. ""But all this is in advance, based on his electoral promises.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin has exchanged pleasantries with Trump and signaled he may seek a rapprochement with the United States under its new administration. Trump has also suggested he may lift biting economic sanctions slapped on Russia for its annexation of Crimea.

""It looks like a Christmas gift from the American people with very beautiful packaging, but we don't know what is inside,"" former Russian lawmaker Sergei Markov said.

Like Markov, many of the well-dressed crowd at the retro-themed nightclub were similarly enthusiastic about the incoming U.S. president.

""I do support Trump, I hope he will make relations better,"" said Alexey Smirnov, a tattooed 49-year-old musician, although he admitted that he was mainly there for the music.

Others are worried, however. One opposition leader, Vladimir Ryzhkov, said he feared that ""Donald Trump will close his eyes on democracy and human rights and freedom of the press and political prisoners in Russia.""

Related: Russian Rights Groups Urge Trump Not to Forget Them

Even at the Kremlin, Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told the BBC that they would not be watching the inauguration, instead celebrating the Orthodox Christmas holiday, Epiphany, in which people skinny-dip in the frigid outdoor winter.

Russia was just one of many nations reacting to Trump's imminent inauguration Friday, and anticipating what his administration will mean for their part of the world.

Israel

Trump's promise to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem has pleased Israeli right-wingers but dismayed Palestinian leaders.

After a fractious relationship with President Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has welcomed Trump's incoming administration. In December, both men condemned the Obama administration's abstention from a United Nations resolution labeling Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal.

""After eight difficult years, a true friend is entering the White House,"" Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat said Wednesday ahead of Trump's inaugural. ""Together, we will remind Washington that Israel remains its greatest friend and closest ally.""

""I’m happy for him, it can show us that everyone can become a president, and maybe its nice to see a businessman as a president,"" Bat Sheva Hass, 35, said.

Despite these overtures from Russia and Israel, the president-elect has recorded historic unpopularity in other parts of the world.

Just 9 percent of people living in the European Union have confidence in Trump's foreign policy game, according to a Pew study in June. That figure is just 8 percent in Japan, 14 percent in India and 22 percent in China.

The West Bank

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has criticized Trump's vows to move the U.S. embassy in Israel, saying Saturday that ""it will not help peace and we hope it does not happen.""

It's a sentiment echoed by many Palestinians on the day of Trump's inauguration. The Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.

Raful Saade, 26, called the move ""dangerous,"" warning that the decision could lead to more bloodshed.

""At the end of the day we want peace, peace is obtainable if the two sides want it, and by moving the embassy it won’t be happening any time soon,"" said 17-year-old Sona Hazbun. ""It’ll be stopping the peace process.""

China

Trump spent much of his presidential campaign attacking Beijing's allegedly unfair trade practices, and even threatening to launch what experts said amounted to a trade war.

While the Chinese government has refrained from reacting with bombastic statements, one state-run newspaper warned the U.S. to ""bone up on nuclear power strategies."" This was after Trump's pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, suggested he might try to stop China accessing China's controversial outposts that it has built in the disputed South China Sea.

However, some Chinese citizens, such as 41-year-old lawyer Jenny Chen, are more upbeat about Trump's impact on their country.

""I'm in general very optimistic, in a cautious way,"" said Chen, who is from the southeastern province of Fujian. ""I think China and America will remain good trade partners. I don’t think they will abandon each other’s business interests just over small disputes.""

Xiong Li, a 25-year-old software engineer from Jiangxi, agreed.

""For the past two decades, especially for the past few presidents, they are almost the same,"" Xiong told NBC News. ""This is the first time an outsider, a true outsider, is coming to the White House. I think it will bring some change. Hopefully some good change, positive change.""

However, Xiong conceded that ""one thing i think is a little bit dangerous to me is, Trump seems to be a dictator.""

Iraq

Trump moves into the White House at a time when the U.S. remains locked in battle with ISIS across Iraq and Syria.

Although he originally supported the war, Trump spent much of the campaign saying that the invasion ""may have been the worst decision"" in presidential history. It's not clear what his next move in the region would be, but many Iraqis are angry at America's impact on their country over the past three decades.

""What goes around comes around … America should pay the price of invading my country,"" said 29-year-old Marwa Fadhel, who works in Iraq's Ministry of Oil. ""Having such a president is a curse from God, and this is the price that Americans are going to pay for invading my country.""

Tawfeeq Majeed Mohammed, a 43-year-old English teacher, called Trump a ""clown"" and said that ""America is going to gain more enemies and haters than it had before"" because of his policies.

Not everyone was so negative, however. Wurud Salih, a 32-year-old journalist from Basra, said that Trump would ""bring balance to the region.""

Egypt

Trump's proposal to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem is sending ripple effects to Israel's southern neighbor as Egyptians try to brace for the next American administration.

“I don’t feel secure now,"" Hanan Mahmoud, 45, said. ""I am afraid he will make a war in the Arab countries. That is what frightens me.”

Forty-year-old Ahmed Ibrahim voiced concerns that Trump didn't seem fully prepared for the job and that his rhetoric sounded increasingly isolationist.

""He is only talking about his country, 100 percent,"" Ibrahim said. ""When Obama spoke he spoke about many countries, but [Trump] only spoke about America.""

Europe and elsewhere

Anti-Trump demonstrations took place and were expected in as many as 57 countries on Friday, according to various groups, including the Women’s March on Washington, a movement critical of the rhetoric used during the election cycle.

In London, protesters from the Bridges Not Walls group unfurled a banner on the city's iconic Tower Bridge reading: ""Act now! Build bridges not walls,"" a reference to Trump's promise to build a wall on the Mexican border.

On Westminster Bridge, near the Houses of Parliament, another banner read: ""Migrants welcome here,"" referring to the president-elect's statement during the campaign that America should halt all Muslims from entering the country.

When he was mayor of London in 2015, British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said that Trump was ""clearly out of his mind"" and ""frankly unfit to hold the office of president of the United States,"" after Trump claimed some parts of London were ""no-go areas"" for police because of the threat posed by Muslims.

After Trump's election, however, Johnson has fallen in line with the British government's official stance that it is looking forward to working with its long-time ally.

Following a similar display after Trump was elected, some European newspapers used their front pages to mark the occasion.

Britain's measured tone was repeated in Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Friday that his alliance with the U.S. was ""the cornerstone of our nation’s diplomatic and security policies,"" something he called an ""immutable principle.""

However, the country was among those that saw protests against Trump's inaugural.

In Germany, Trump's criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as German trade and the European Union, has caused alarm among officials.

""This day really marks a celebration of American democracy and usually people here look at Washington with admiration … but I think this time it's different,"" said Niels Annen, foreign affairs spokesman for the center-left SPD party, a coalition partner in the government.

He said that on inauguration day there would be ""a lot of uncertainty and also I think some resentment.""

NBC,George Floyd Death,'I can't breathe': Man dies after pleading with officer attempting to detain him in Minneapolis,"A man exclaiming ""I can't breathe"" as a Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground and put his knee on the man's neck for about eight minutes died Monday night, prompting the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to step in and investigate.

Video of the incident shows that a white police officer had a black man pinned to the ground next to the back tire of his patrol car with his knee on the man's neck.

""Please, please, please, I can't breathe,"" the man begs. ""My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Please, please. I can't breathe.""

Onlookers outside the Minneapolis deli urge the officer to get off the man.

""You're stopping his breathing right now, you think that's cool?"" one man says. ""His nose is bleeding. Look at his nose!"" says a woman.

The officer does not budge.

And then the man goes silent. More people begin to intervene and call for the officer or his partner to check for a pulse. The officer remains on the man's neck, even as he lies apparently unresponsive, for a total of about eight minutes before paramedics arrive and the man is placed on a stretcher.

""The man looked already dead before the ambulance even got there. He was clearly trying to tell them he couldn't breathe, and they ignored him,"" Darnella Frazier, one of the people who recorded the incident, told NBC News.

NBC News does not know what happened before the video recording began.

Civil rights lawyer Benjamin Crump said in a statement that he was representing the family of the man, whom he identified as George Floyd.

""We all watched the horrific death of George Floyd on video as witnesses begged the police officer to take him into the police car and get off his neck. This abusive, excessive and inhumane use of force cost the life of a man who was being detained by police for questioning about a non-violent charge,"" Crump said.

""We will seek justice for the family of George Floyd, as we demand answers from the Minneapolis Police Department,"" Crump added. ""How many 'while black' deaths will it take until the racial profiling and undervaluing of black lives by police finally ends.""

Minneapolis police said in a statement early Tuesday that the officers had responded to a report of a forgery in progress and found the suspect in his car. He stepped out of the car when he was ordered to, police said, but then physically resisted officers.

""Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress,"" the statement said. ""Officers called for an ambulance. He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance where he died a short time later.""

The four officers involved have been fired, Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted Tuesday afternoon.

""This is the right call,"" he said.

The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis said in a statement that it was not the time to rush to judgment and that the officers were fully cooperating in the investigation.

""We must review all video. We must wait for the medical examiner's report,"" the statement said. ""Officers' actions and training protocol will be carefully examined after the officers have provided their statements.""

Initially, police said the department had called in the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to investigate independently. A short time later, the department announced that the FBI would also be investigating.

""We put out the information that we believed to be wholly honest and true. As we dug into it deeper, we realized that in fact it would be appropriate to have the FBI be apart of this investigation as well,"" said the department's director of public information, John Elder.

""The public has seen the video. To call this a 'medical incident' is an insult.""

Police Chief Medaria Arradondo added during a news conference Tuesday morning: ""There was additional information that I had received, quite frankly, from a community source that just provided more context than what I had preliminary, originally."" That prompted him to get the FBI involved ""knowing that there could be a question of civil rights.""

Federal agents were on the ground, Arradondo said. Body camera video was available, but has not been made public. Police said no weapons were used by anyone involved in the incident.

He said the officers were on paid leave. Neither of the officers in the video has been identified by the police.

The state public safety bureau said investigators would like to speak with anyone who recorded or witnessed the incident. The bureau would be sharing its findings with the FBI and presenting the completed investigation to the Hennepin County attorney's office for review.

""What we saw was horrible, completely and utterly messed up,"" Mayor Jacob Frey said of the video during the news conference. ""I believe what I saw, and what I saw was wrong at every level.""

""This man's life matters,"" Frey said. ""He should not have died. He was a human being, and his life mattered. ... Whatever the investigation reveals, it does not change the single truth that he should be with us this morning.""

""Being black in America should not be a death sentence,"" Frey said. ""When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help, and this officer failed in the most basic human sense.""

A protest was planned for Tuesday night at the scene. Frey encouraged protesters to express their anger but asked them to do so safely and while social distancing.

Jessi Zendejas asked people who remembered the ""gentle giant"" who worked as a security guard at a Minneapolis bar and restaurant to ""please stand with us.""

""Everyone who knows him knew he loved his hugs from his regulars when working as a security guard and would be mad if you didn’t stop to greet him because he honestly loved seeing everyone and watching everyone have fun,"" Zendejas wrote on Facebook.

Jovanni Thunstrom, the owner of Conga Latin Bistro, said Floyd had worked there as a security guard for more than five years. He said Floyd was also a friend and had been a tenant of his.

He wrote on Facebook that he first saw the video and later found out the person who died was Floyd. He said he was writing the post through teary eyes.

""My employee George Floyd was murdered by a police officer that had no compassion, used his position to commit a murder of someone that was begging for his life,"" Thunstrom wrote.

In a statement, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said: ""Justice must be served for this man and his family, justice must be served for our community, and justice must be served for our country.""

""We heard his repeated calls for help. We heard him say over and over again that he could not breathe. And now we have seen yet another horrifying and gut-wrenching instance of an African American man dying,"" Klobuchar said.

In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Minnesota called for a fair investigation and justice for Floyd.

""Nearly six years after Eric Garner's death in New York — and four years after Philando Castile's in Minnesota — this tragic video shows how little meaningful change has emerged to prevent police from taking the lives of Black people,"" said Paige Fernandez, policing policy adviser for the national ACLU. ""Make no mistake: George Floyd should be alive today. The officers responsible must be held accountable.""

""The public has seen the video,"" Fernandez added. ""To call this a 'medical incident' is an insult.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-dies-after-pleading-i-can-t-breathe-during-arrest-n1214586

More than 200 congressional lawmakers now calling for Trump's removal More than 200 members of the U.S. Senate and House support the removal of President Donald Trump, according to an NBC News' count. The calls are in reaction to Wednesday's riot at the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, which followed months of Trump claiming the election he lost was fraudulent or stolen, claims for which there is no evidence, and a rally Wednesday. Trump has been accused of inciting the violence. The measures discussed include a possible second impeachment or the 25th Amendment. Almost all are Democrats or Independents; Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Illinois, is the only Republican. Trump will leave office in a little less than two weeks, on Jan. 20 when Joe Biden is inaugurated.

U.S. diplomats to tell world 'order will be restored, those responsible will be held to account' After public outcries of shock and dismay from U.S. democratic allies around the world, the State Department has sent talking points to U.S. diplomats abroad on how to address the pro-Trump riots that broke out at the U.S. Capitol. The note makes clear that the State Department’s official position is that President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn in as the next president of the United States. Till now, guidance to posts about the presidential transition has been limited, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been reticent to publicly acknowledge Biden’s victory. “As is being called for by representatives from across the political spectrum, order will be restored, those responsible will be held to account, and the democratic process will continue,” the communication reads. “President-elect Biden will be inaugurated on January 20.” The State Department memo ended with a list of hand-chosen “bipartisan quotes” from President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and Biden.

Sen. Ted Cruz says Trump 'bears some responsibility' for Capitol riot U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who joined a doomed effort to ""audit"" the election results that was criticized as a publicity stunt, has said that President Donald Trump ""plainly bears some responsibility"" for Wednesday's riot at the Capitol. Cruz, R-Texas, made the comments in an interview with NBC Dallas-Fort Worth, broadcast a day after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol. ""Look, I think he plainly bears some responsibility,"" Cruz said. ""At the end of the day, criminals are responsible for their own conduct and the terrorists who conducted that attack, they bear the responsibility. But I think his angry rhetoric was reckless, and I think it was harmful."" Cruz joined a handful of senators to support Republican objections to counting the electoral votes in Arizona and Pennsylvania, neither of which succeeded. Cruz had called for Congress to “appoint an electoral commission to examine claims of electoral fraud."" There has been no evidence of the voter fraud Trump has baselessly claimed. Cruz has argued his efforts were to give Americans ""confidence"" in the election. Share this -







Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is second Cabinet member to resign On Thursday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos became the second Cabinet member to resign after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol. In her resignation letter to President Donald Trump, DeVos said her boss played a direct role in the violence. “There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it’s the inflection point for me,” she wrote. “Impressionable children are watching all of this, and they are learning from us,” she wrote. “… they must know from us that America is greater than what transpired yesterday.” Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao announced her resignation earlier in the day.

Wall Street Journal editorial calls on Trump to resign rather than be impeached The Wall Street Journal's editorial board condemned President Donald Trump for Wednesday's deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol, and said he should resign rather than face the prospect of a second impeachment. ""It is best for everyone, himself included, if he goes away quietly,"" the board, which is generally seen as conservative, wrote in the editorial published online Thursday. The Journal is owned by a company controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch. It says the president of the United States ""incited a crowd to march on the legislative branch"" and called it ""an assault on the constitutional process of transferring power after an election."" They say Trump was also to blame for waiting too long to call off the rioters and for hedging when he did, and was accused of betraying his supporters by lying to them about the election. ""If Mr. Trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his best path would be to take personal responsibility and resign,"" the editorial board wrote. ""We know an act of grace by Mr. Trump isn’t likely. In any case this week has probably finished him as a serious political figure,"" the editorial reads. Thursday evening Trump in a video address acknowledged a new administration will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. Share this -

New York Post,House Speaker,PELOSI BILL BLASTED AS PORK FOR TUNA,"WASHINGTON – Red-faced House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went into damage-control mode yesterday after Republicans charged she slipped a loophole into the Democrats’ just-passed minimum-wage bill to benefit a company in her San Francisco district.

The legislation hiking the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour covered the entire United States and all its territories – except for one: American Samoa.

The GOP said Samoa was exempted because Democrat Pelosi is protecting the food giant Del Monte Corp., which is based in her district. Del Monte owns StarKist Tuna, which employs more 5,000 Samoans, almost 75 percent of the island’s work force.

The company had opposed the legislation, which passed Wednesday. The legislation increases the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour.

In the face of the GOP accusations that she delivered special favors to the company, Pelosi ordered the House Education and Labor Committee to study wages in American Samoa, the only U.S. territory not covered by basic federal minimum-wage laws.

“Our committee will review minimum-wage standards in American Samoa to determine how we can ensure the fair treatment of Samoa’s workers,” said Tom Kiley, spokesman for House Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller (D-Calif.).

Republicans trawling for attack lines against the new Democratic majority said the omission of American Samoa from the federal minimum-wage law stinks.

“This is nothing more than protecting a hometown company. It’s an abuse of power,” Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.) told The Post.

Wages in American Samoa and other U.S. territories are set by special industry committees under the Federal Department of Labor. Minimum pay varies by industry, but generally does not go above $4 an hour.

Most territories, such as Guam, follow the national laws, but wages in American Samoa remain low by national standards.

A spokeswoman for Del Monte denied the company lobbied Pelosi. Pelosi’s spokeswoman also denied receiving any campaign contributions from Del Monte, which federal campaign records confirm.

“Two weeks into the minority and all the Republicans can do is go fishing,” Pelosi spokeswoman Jennifer Crider told The Post.

The minimum-wage bill was drafted by Miller’s committee, and Pelosi had little input on the nitty-gritty details of the legislation, House sources said.

Kiley noted that Republicans consistently blocked efforts to get the minimum wage to other territories during the years of their party’s majority.

New York Post,Hurricane Katrina,HURRICANE KATRINA SPELLS PROFIT FOR OIL GOONS,"A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J – and then finally K.

It took oil speculators nearly half the alphabet before they got what they desperately needed – a hurricane named Katrina with enough punch to legitimately threaten U.S. oil production in the Gulf of Mexico.

And with that the oil goons did what they do best: They jacked up the price of crude well beyond the irrational level.

The price of oil rose more than $4 a barrel at one point yesterday in the futures market to $70.80, which was easily a record, and the speculators have made their money and inflicted their damage on the world economy.

Well done, guys! Sleep well tonight.

You couldn’t tell it by the screwballs who have hijacked the crude market this year, but there is plenty of oil in the world.

According to the federal government’s Energy Information Administration, there are 322.9 million barrels of crude currently out of the ground in the U.S. and waiting to be used. That’s up sharply from the 285.3 million during the same week last year.

And there’s plenty of gasoline as well – 194.9 million barrels, to be exact. That is down from the 209.6 million barrels last year. But the drawdown in gas has come mostly in the past few weeks and probably has more to do with a changeover to a heavier winter fuel blend.

As the U.S. is past its heralded “peak driving season,” gasoline inventories are likely to rise in the next couple of weeks.

The speculators, of course, have answers for everything.

When the supply-side argument fails, the speculators will use their backup: that oil demand is booming, especially in China.

And all the inventory numbers have been rising despite the increase in the government’s Strategic Petroleum Reserves to its maximum capacity of 700 million barrels of crude, from 667 million this time last year.

Sen. Chuck Schumer yesterday called on the government to put some of that SPR oil on the market to bring down prices.

I have another idea. The New York senator should ask his colleagues to investigate whether Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs – which has been predicting $105-a-barrel oil for some time and salivating over the idea – have been profiteering on oil speculation.

Nobody wants to deprive the speculators of their blood money. But it’s just too easy to move the price of oil higher if someone is inclined to do so.

There is no “spot” price for oil, like other commodities. So you can’t determine what someone would pay if they wanted a barrel of oil delivered to their doorstep today.

Oil trades through futures contracts, which represent 1,000 barrels of crude to be delivered sometime in the future. Each of those contracts gives a speculator control of more than $68,500 worth of oil (at $68.50 a barrel). But a speculator only has to put up the $4,325 margin price for each contract.

Right now, there are 244,405 contracts outstanding, which represents 244.4 million barrels of future oil.

That’s plenty reason for speculators to want the price to keep climbing and more than enough reasons for Washington to stop them from doing it.",https://nypost.com/2005/08/30/hurricane-katrina-spells-profit-for-oil-goons/
New York Post,Hussein Executed,SADDAM IS THE KING OF SWING; BYE-BYE TO BUTCHER OF BAGHDAD AS DIABOLICAL DICTATOR IS HANGED BEFORE ; DAWN TO DELIGHT OF ; OPPRESSED IRAQIS,"The Butcher of Baghdad is no more.

Former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein – clutching a Koran as he was led to the gallows – was hanged today in the city he ruled with an iron fist for decades at 6 a.m. Baghdad time, officials said.

His death was greeted with elation by those present at the execution, which included dancing over Hussein’s body, witnesses said.

A handcuffed Hussein was clad completely in black, with a jacket, trousers, hat and shoes – not the orange prison garb he was expected to wear.

Shortly before the execution, Hussein’s hat was removed and he was asked if he wanted to say something, said Sami al-Askari, the political adviser of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.

” ‘No I don’t want to,’ ” al-Askari, who was present at the execution, quoted the ousted despot as telling him.

He then repeated a prayer told to him by a Sunni Muslim cleric.

“Saddam later was taken to the gallows and refused to have his head covered with a hood,” al-Askari said. “Before the rope was put around his neck, Saddam shouted: ‘God is great. The nation will be victorious and Palestine is Arab.’ ”

The predawn hanging was necessary because Iraqi law prohibits executions on holy days. The Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, the Festival of Sacrifice, began at sunrise.

In November, Hussein, 69, was convicted of crimes against humanity after ordering the murders of 148 Shiite villagers from Dujail after a failed assassination bid in 1982.

Saddam’s two co-defendants, his half-brother Barzan al-Tikriti and former Iraqi chief judge Awad Hamed al-Bandar of the Revolutionary Court, will be hanged at a later time, officials said.

Iraq’s Prime Minister Nuri al- Maliki urged Saddam Hussein’s fellow Sunni Baathists today to reconsider their tactics and join the political process.

“I urged followers of the ousted regime to reconsider their stance as the door is still open to anyone who has no innocent blood on his hands, to help in rebuilding an Iraq for all Iraqis,” Maliki said in a statement issued hours after Saddam was executed.

Meanwhile, jubilant Shiites – oppressed under Saddam – danced in the streets of their holy city of Najaf while cars blared their horns in procession through Baghdad’s Shiite-ruled Sadr City.

The execution took place at a specially built gallows close to Camp Cropper, near Baghdad International Airport, where the former dictator was being held. It was reportedly overseen by at least seven witnesses, including the Iraqi National Security Advisor Mowaffeq al-Rubaie, Justice Minster Hashim al-Shilbli, the judge who presided over his trial, and a Sunni Muslim cleric.

Al-Rubaie told Iraqiya that Hussein appeared to be a “broken man” before he mounted the scaffold.

He said Hussein “totally surrendered” and did not resist.

When he stood in the execution room, photographs and video footage were taken, al-Rubaie said.

“He did not ask for anything. He was carrying a Koran and said: ‘I want this Koran to be given to this person,’ a man he called Bander,” he said.

Al-Rubaie also said he did not know who Bander was.

“Saddam was treated with respect when he was alive and after his death,” al-Rubaie said. “Saddam’s execution was 100 percent Iraqi and the American side did not interfere.”

“Saddam was taken by force to the gallows but he was composed when taken to execution,” said al-Askari.

Then, “we heard his neck snap,” said al-Askari at the exact moment of Saddam’s death.

The officials said the government had not yet decided what to do with Saddam’s body.

The Iraqiya television station aired national songs after the first announcement of Hussein’s death and had a tag on the screen that read, “Saddam’s execution marks the end of a dark period of Iraq’s history.”

In a farewell message to Iraqis posted Wednesday on the Internet, Saddam said he was giving his life for his country as part of the struggle against the U.S.

“Here, I offer my soul to God as a sacrifice, and if he wants, he will send it to heaven with the martyrs,” he said.

Even as the brutal strongman’s final moments ticked away, there was a torrent of activity in Baghdad and Washington in the hours proceeding Saddam’s death:

* Hussein gave his will and personal belonging to two of his half-brothers in a final jailhouse meeting, one of his lawyers said.

* Hussein’s daughter and a member of his defense team also asked for a chance to say goodbye but were denied.

“His daughter in Amman was crying, she said, ‘Take me with you,’ ” lawyer Najeeb al-Nueimi said.

She later asked that “his body be buried in Yemen temporarily until Iraq is liberated and it can be reburied in Iraq,” a source close to the family said.

* U.S. and Iraqi officials agreed during a meeting yesterday on an execution time after daylong speculation that it would be put off for religious or other reasons.

* U.S. and Iraqi forces were put on high alert and braced for violent reactions to the execution.

“We will put all our forces on the streets so that no lives are jeopardized,” said Iraqi Brig. Gen. Abdel Karim Khalaf.

* The State Department cabled all U.S. embassies to warn them to be prepared for terrorist attacks. Although as of late last night there was little violence – just rejoicing.

* Defense lawyers filed papers at a federal appeals court in Washington seeking an emergency restraining order to block the execution.

* Nevertheless, Munir Haddad, a judge on the appeals court that upheld the death sentence, said all documents required for the execution were ready.

That includes the infamous “red card” – an order of condemnation that was created during Hussein’s regime and was to be given to a death row inmate on his final day.

Hussein had been in U.S. custody since he was found in late 2003 hiding in a “spider hole” near Tikrit .

Nueimi said the U.S. wanted to prevent Hussein from being humiliated before his execution and want to prevent the mutilation of his corpse, as has happened to other deposed Iraqi leaders.

If Hussein is humiliated publicly or his corpse ill-treated “that could cause an uprising, and the Americans would be blamed,” he said.

The identity of Hussein’s hangman, who was be hooded, was a closely guarded secret.

A doctor was also present to certify Saddam’s death.

A photograph of Hussein’s body is expected to be released later today to prevent rumors that he is still alive.

The death of Hussein, a Sunni, was greeted with rejoicing by Iraq’s Shiite majority.

It is “God’s gift to Iraqis,” Sheik Sadralddin al-Qubanji said in his sermon yesterday in Najaf.

“Oh, God, you know what Saddam has done! He killed millions of Iraqis in prisons, in wars with neighboring countries, and he is responsible for mass graves.”

But Hussein’s death sentence has drawn condemnation from a wide range of critics, on political and moral grounds.

International human rights groups criticized the year-long trial, during which three defense lawyers were killed and a chief judge resigned complaining of political interference.

“The test of a government’s commitment to human rights is measured by the way it treats its worst offenders,” said Richard Dicker, Director of Human Rights Watch. “History will judge the deeply flawed Dujail trial and this execution harshly.”

The United Nations and many of Washington’s Western allies had called on Bush and Maliki not to go ahead with the execution.

“Influenza activity usually increases between December and March when temperatures and humidity are lower. So we urge people to prepare for it by getting vaccinated,” said Dr. Thomas Farley, the city’s health commissioner.

Schools are administering free flu mist and flu shots tailored to swine flu, also known as the H1N1 virus.

City officials note that the H1N1 vaccination should be taken in addition to traditional flu shots.

“Seasonal influenza vaccine does not protect against the H1N1 virus. To protect against both kinds of influenza, people will need two different vaccinations: one for seasonal influenza, and one for H1N1 influenza,” health experts say.

But there’s one problem — it seems the demand for the H1N1 and seasonal flu shots outweighs the supply of the vaccines.

According to published reports, doctors are running out of the vaccines or never received them due to high demand from other medical offices.

However, health officials note that these are the initial vaccine shipments and more should arrive in the coming weeks. Most flu shots are administered in the winter, they say.

New York Post,Obama Elected,BARACK OBAMA WINS THE PRESIDENCY,"Barack Obama scored a barrier-breaking victory tonight to become the first black president of the United States – capping a 22-month quest that tapped into a national hunger for “hope” and “change.”

At age 47 and still serving his first Senate term, the Democrat cleared a historic hurdle that seemed insurmountable just a few years ago – and was bolstered by Democrats padding their majority in Congress.

COMPLETE ELECTION 2008 COVERAGE

Speaking to 125,000 supporters tonight in Chicago, Obama said, “If there is anyone out there who doubts that America is a place where anything is possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.”

“It’s been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America,” he added.

Obama held blue-tilting Pennsylvania and its 21 electoral votes by large margins, despite a massive effort by GOP Sen. John McCain to try to score a win there to shore up his faltering numbers elsewhere.

But for Obama, who merely needed to hold every state John Kerry won in 2004 and pick up one George W. Bush state in order to clinch victory, things started to break at around 9:30 p.m., when several media outlets called Ohio for the Democrat.

No Republican has won the White House without capturing battleground Ohio, which has 20 electoral votes.

The historic day was studded with several key events:

National voter turnout appeared set to break records, with several states reporting long lines at polling sites.

Several experts said the turnout was on pace to break the 1968 record of 61.9 percent – and in states like Connecticut, officials said it was set to top 90 percent.

Roughly 187 million people were registered to vote, and, thanks to early voting in more than 30 states, some 40 million had already cast ballots before yesterday.

Obama-friendly New York saw heavy turnout in western parts of the state – and in the Big Apple, astonishing waits of up to four hours in places like Harlem started when polls opened before dawn.

The economy was the No. 1 issue for a whopping 62 percent of voters in exit polls – a topic that overwhelmingly favored Obama in the campaign.

While 72-year-old former prisoner-of-war McCain kept up a strong front as he zipped on a mad dash through seven swing states on Monday, his top campaign aides clearly signaled a loss was imminent.

“We did our absolute best in really difficult circumstances,” a key McCain strategist told reporters on the campaign plane. “We had tough cards to play all the way through and we hung in there all the way.

“You look back in the middle of September – [the] economic collapse of the country – we did the best we can in historically different circumstances,” he added.

McCain himself sounded a valedictory note as his campaign plane returned to Arizona yesterday, saying, “We’ve had a great ride, a great experience and it’s full of memories that we will always treasure.”

He added he was “feeling good, feeling confident about the way things have turned out,” as he fondly recalled traveling in the GOP primaries – when he was broke and left for dead, but ended up coming back with a New Hampshire primary win.

Obama ran a campaign that sought to appeal to everyone and he rarely mentioned his race – but his candidacy was still buoyed by black voters thrilled with the prospect of seeing history made.

Initially, he drew on anger over the Iraq war, but by the end of the race, the combination of an unpopular President Bush and a crippling economic tide helped catapult Obama over McCain.

And he helped allay fears about whether he had the mettle for the job by first slaying his larger-than-life Democratic opponent, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.

In the final days of the race, McCain was in search of a message that would stick against Obama – bringing out the now-infamous “Joe the Plumber” to help paint the Democrat as a socialist looking to “spread the wealth,” as he rapped Obama’s tax proposals.

At the same time, national Republicans brought out Obama’s former pastor, the inflammatory Rev. Jeremiah Wright, in last-minute attack ads.

But nothing stuck.

Instead of last-minute rallies like McCain, Obama ended yesterday with his ritual Election Day basketball game with pals in Chicago, where he held a massive nighttime rally as the returns came in.

Obama had an emotional lead-up to Election Day, taking two days off the trail to visit his dying maternal grandmother in Hawaii less than two weeks ago.

She died Monday, and he was moved to tears as he discussed her passing at his final rally of the day.

Obama’s campaign was also rocked Sunday when his Nevada state director, Harlem-bred operative Terence Tolbert, died unexpectedly of a massive heart attack at age 44.",https://nypost.com/2008/11/05/barack-obama-wins-the-presidency/
New York Post,Boston Marathon Bombings,"Terror attack strikes Boston Marathon, more than 130 injured; person of interest ID’d","BOSTON — More than 130 people were injured today as multiple explosions rocked the Boston Marathon in a “coordinated” terror attack.

Two explosions were detonated at the race’s finish line within seconds of each other, beginning at 2:50 p.m. Three other undetonated devices were later discovered by authorities.

A White House official told Bloomberg news, “Any event with multiple explosive devices — as this appears to be — is clearly an act of terror.”

Homeland Security committee member Rep. Bill Keating (D-MA) called today’s explosions a “sophisticated, coordinated event.”

WCVB in Boston is reporting that an 8-year-old boy was among those killed in Monday’s attack.

Law-enforcement sources said at least the first explosion occurred in the lobby of a nearby hotel.

EXPLOSIONS CAUSE UK TO REVIEW MARATHON SECURITY

“There were two bombs that exploded near the finish line in today’s Boston Marathon,” The Boston Marathon’s official Facebook page read. “We are working with law enforcement to understand what exactly has happened.”

The airspace above the city was ordered cleared as well and was briefly designated a no-fly zone, which has since been lifted, by the FAA following the explosions.

Police confirmed a third explosion at JFK Library in Boston but officials later said it was unrelated to the marathon attack. There were no injuries reported from the third bombing.

“Fire in building is out, appears to have started in the mechanical room of new building,” The JFK Library’s Twitter account read. “All staff and visitors are accounted for and safe.”

A law enforcement official told the Associated Press that officials shut down cellular service throughout the Boston area to prevent remote detonation of explosives. Cellular service has since been restored but it is still difficult to communicate with anyone in the Boston area, according to witness reports.

Cops also issued an all-points-bulletin for a yellow Penske truck or van that tried to get access to a marathon site, claiming it had medical supplies — and then sped off or was turned away.

President Obama, was briefed about the incident shortly after the explosions occured.

The Secret Service said they have expanded the security perimeter around the White House out of “an abundance of caution.”

Obama called Boston mayor Tom Menino and Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick to express his concern for those that were injured and make clear that his administration is ready to provide needed support as they respond to this incident.

“The American people will say a prayer for Boston tonight and Michelle and I send our deepest thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims in the wake of this senseless loss,” Obama said Monday evening.

Gov. Patrick released a statement this afternoon.

“This is a horrific day in Boston. My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been injured. I have been in touch with the President, Mayor Menino and our public safety leaders. Our focus is on making sure that the area around Copley Square is safe and secured. I am asking everyone to stay away from Copley Square and let the first responders do their jobs.”

The after-effects from the explosions reverberated across the nation, including in New York City.

“This changes everything [in New York],’’ one source told The Post. “Everyone’s on high alert. Our marathon was canceled in November. Who knows if that changed someone’s plans?’’

The NYPD has ramped up its anti-terror efforts at landmarks and other potential terrorist targets “to make sure there’s no nonsense going on here,’’ a law-enforcement source said.

Officers are scouring live feed from surveillance videos throughout the city to monitor possible events, the source said.

NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said that the NYPD has deployed its Critical Response Vehicles as well until more about the explosion is learned.

The FDNY says their units have also been advised to use elevated caution due to the explosions.

Mayor Bloomberg released a statement following the explosions.

“As law enforcement authorities investigate today’s explosions in Boston, I ask all New Yorkers to keep the victims and their families in your thoughts and prayers,” Bloomberg said. “I have spoken with Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, and the NYPD has stepped up security at strategic locations and critical infrastructure, including our subways.”

Governor Cuomo echoed Bloomberg’s sentiments and saying that state agencies have all been placed on a heightened state of alert.

Relatives of the victims of December’s school massacre in Newtown, Conn. were among those attending the race finish at a VIP area. It was not known of any of the relatives were among the casualties.

Competitors and race organizers were crying as they fled the chaos. Bloody spectators were being carried to the medical tent that had been set up to care for fatigued runners.

“There are a lot of people down,” said one man, whose bib No. 17528 identified him as Frank Deruyter of North Carolina. He was not injured, but marathon workers were carrying one woman, who did not appear to be a runner, to the medical area as blood gushed from her leg. A Boston police officer was wheeled from the course with a leg injury that was bleeding.

About three hours after the winners crossed the line, there was a loud explosion on the north side of Boylston Street, just before the photo bridge that marks the finish line. Another thunderous explosion could be heard a few seconds later.

Runner Laura McLean of Toronto said she heard two explosions outside the medical tent.

Cherie Falgoust was waiting for her husband, who was running the race.

”I was expecting my husband any minute,” she said. “I don’t know what this building is … it just blew. Just a big bomb, a loud boom, and then glass everywhere. Something hit my head. I don’t know what it was. I just ducked.”

About half of the runners — virutally all the elite competitors — had completed the course when the twin explosions went off.

It created a mad rush of bystanders, who frantically dashed away from the scene. Moments later, first responders ran to the wounded, as their blood stained the Boston pavement.

Smoke filled the previously crystal-clear sky and the sounds of sirens rang for blocks.

Ukraine’s military responded by scrambling its air force to the region, as the Foreign Ministry denounced the troop movement as an “invasion” and demanded the Russians “immediately withdraw.”

“Ukraine reserves the right to use all necessary measures to stop the military invasion by Russia,” the ministry said in a statement.

As many as 120 Russian soldiers took over the southern village of Strilkove and a nearby gas plant over fears it would be targeted by terrorists, Ukrainian officials said.

No shots had been fired in the standoff — about 80 miles from Crimea — between the two militaries late Saturday. The foray appears to be Russia’s first move outside Crimea, where its forces have been in control since last month.

In the wake of Russia’s takeover of Strilkove, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called for military aid to Ukraine. “Ukraine is going to need a long-term military assistance program from the United States,” McCain told reporters following a Senate delegation visit to Kiev.

“When [Ukrainians] ask for some modest means that can help them resist, I believe we should provide it . . . it’s simply the right and decent thing to do.”

As the critical vote neared, two people were killed and dozens injured late Friday in a shootout between Russian separatists and pro-Ukrainian demonstrators in Kharkiv — a hotbed of pro-Russia sentiment.

The referendum was denounced by the government in Kiev as “illegal,” and Western countries are threatening Russia with sanctions if it incorporates Crimea.

On Saturday, Russia stood firm, vetoing a US-sponsored resolution at the United Nations declaring the referendum illegal while China, an ally, abstained.

US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power said the vote shows Russia is, “isolated, alone, wrong.”",https://nypost.com/2014/03/15/russian-forces-move-into-ukraine-on-the-eve-of-referendum/
New York Post,Gay Marriage ,Supreme Court approves gay marriage nationwide,"The Supreme Court ruled Friday that gay and lesbian couples have the same right to marry as any other American in a landmark decision that settled one of the most contentious social issues in US history.

Celebrations and joyful weddings quickly followed around the country, including in some of the 14 states where they had been banned before the decision.

President Obama hailed the decision from the White House, saying it had arrived “like a thunderbolt” and “made our union a little more perfect.”

“When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free,” he declared.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, a ­Republican appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1988, was once again the swing vote who joined the court’s liberal bloc to provide the 5-4 majority.

Kennedy rejected arguments that the ruling undermines traditional marriage.

“In forming a marital union, two people be­come something greater than once they were,” he wrote in the decision.

“Marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves.”

But Chief Justice John Roberts warned in his dissent that the ruling opens the door to polygamy.

“From the standpoint of history and tradi­tion, a leap from opposite-sex marriage to same-sex mar­riage is much greater than one from a two-person union to plural unions, which have deep roots in some cultures around the world,” Roberts wrote.

“If the majority is willing to take the big leap, it is hard to see how it can say no to the shorter one.”

Justice Antonin Scalia, in his own scathing dissent, compared the ruling to a judicial coup, arguing that the decision should have been left up to the states.

“What really astounds is the ­hubris reflected in today’s judicial Putsch,” Scalia wrote.

He rejected the majority’s assertion that marriage helps couples find “freedoms, such as expression, intimacy and spirituality.”

“Really?” Scalia wrote. “One would think intimacy is abridged rather than expanded by marriage. Ask the nearest hippie.”

Within minutes of the announcement, more than 100 New Yorkers began partying in the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village — the gay bar that was the site of a 1969 riot that many believe marked the birth of the gay-rights movement.

When the celebration spilled out onto Christopher Street after growing to more than 1,000 people, cops cordoned off surrounding blocks. Several politicians turned up to show their support.

“Love always wins,’’ Public Advocate Letitia James told the happy crowd. “It’s as simple as that.’’

Dustin Pittman, a photographer from the West Village who took pictures at the city’s first Gay Pride Parade in 1970, predicted the party would last all weekend.

“A lot of my friends have died over the years, and I wish they were here to see this. I’ve lost a lot of friends, and I’m celebrating for them. When I photographed the parade 45 years ago, to see the transition to where we are today, it’s incredible,” he said.

Lea Delaria, who plays Big Boo on “Orange Is The New Black,” said, “I have been a professional lesbian since 1982 — before that I freelanced.”

New York Post,Trump Elected,This is how Donald Trump won the election,"Donald Trump’s vow to restore America’s greatness ultimately mattered more than his insults and controversies — sparking surprise shifts in the electorate that helped him upset Hillary Clinton.

Despite blasting Mexicans as “rapists” and “criminals” in his campaign kickoff — and promising right up to Election Day to build a southern border wall — Trump did better among Hispanic voters than 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, exit polling showed.

Romney’s much tamer “self-deportation” plan resulted in just 27 percent support among Hispanics, but Trump — who also vowed to forcibly deport millions of illegal immigrants — won 29 percent of Hispanics.

Clinton’s share of the Hispanic vote — which increased to 11 percent of this year’s electorate, up from 10 percent in 2012 — was 65 percent, a six-point drop from the 71 percent President Obama scored four years ago.

And Trump got 31 percent of voters who said they hadn’t been born US citizens.

Miami resident Josefina Rocabado, who emigrated from the Dominican Republic in 1979, said Trump’s economic policies far outweighed his immigration stance.

“Talk to me about what’s happening in my house,” Rocabado, 50, told USA Today. “I have three kids, one with special needs. In the past eight years, we went from being in the middle class to the bottom of the middle class. We need to pay bills.”

Outrage over the infamous “Access Hollywood” video that caught Trump bragging about grabbing women “by the p—y” — and the deluge of sex-assault allegations that followed — also failed to result in women voters flocking to Clinton, as was widely predicted.

Clinton drew a smaller percentage of the women’s vote than Obama did in 2012. She won 54 percent of women’s votes, down from the 55 percent who backed Obama’s re-election bid. Trump, meanwhile, garnered 42 percent of women, just two points less than Romney.

And Trump — who was branded a bigot for his leading role in the anti-Obama “birther” movement — won 8 percent of black votes, compared to Romney’s 7 percent.

Black support for Clinton, meanwhile, was 88 percent, a five-point drop from the 93 percent who went for Obama in 2012.

The under-30 vote for Republicans remained steady at 37 percent, but Clinton won just 55 percent of that age bracket, which provided a base of support for her vanquished Democratic rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Clinton’s showing with the “millennials” marked another five-point loss compared to Obama’s last outing.

Clinton even lost ground among white voters. While Obama won 39 percent of white votes, Clinton got 37 — even as Trump’s share dropped to 58 percent from Romney’s 59.

“Trump did slightly less well with white voters than Romney and got fewer votes,” said GOP consultant Stuart Stevens, Romney’s chief strategist. “Clinton just didn’t deliver.”

Trump pollster John McLaughlin credited Tuesday’s results to the real estate mogul’s energizing of disaffected, conservative-leaning voters who sat out 2012.

Trump’s campaign identified those tens of millions of registered voters and operatives targeted those who were middle-aged and earned less than $60,000 a year, using polling methods to sift out the ones believed most receptive to Trump.

Six out of 10 wound up being women, many turned out to be unaffiliated with either party and most were “moderate to conservative,” McLaughlin said.

“When we looked at this list, we said we could win,” he said.

The data was then passed along to Trump’s field operations and the Republican National Committee, which contacted likely Trump supporters through at-home visits or phone calls.

They included 1 million voters in Florida and 800,000 in Ohio — both among the five battleground states that Trump flipped from blue to red on Tuesday.

One of the Rust Belt states that Trump turned was Pennsylvania, where he trounced Clinton in Luzerne County, adjacent to Vice President Joe Biden’s hometown of Scranton and where Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 2-to-1, according to the Scranton Times-Tribune.

Pennsylvania Republican chairman Rob Gleason said Trump’s opposition to free-trade deals such as NAFTA struck a chord with voters in the state’s struggling industrial and rural areas.

Clinton’s comments about closing coal mines also sent shudders through the state’s coal country and alarmed other blue-collar workers fearful that their jobs could disappear, Gleason said.

“Trump fit Pennsylvania like a T. People really identified with Trump,” Gleason said.

New York Post,Trump Inauguration,Trump administration disputes crowd numbers at inauguration,"The Trump administration disputed crowd numbers at the swearing-in ceremony despite photos released by the National Park Service that showed a significant difference in the audience from President Barack Obama’s first inauguration in 2009.

Speaking at CIA headquarters on Saturday, Donald Trump blasted the “dishonest media” for underestimating the numbers who came out to witness his swearing-in as the 45th president on Friday.

“It looked honestly – it looked like a million and a half people. Whatever it was, it was. But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument. And I turn on the thing, and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field. And it said we drew 250,000 people. Now that’s not bad, but it’s a lie,” Trump said.

Later Saturday, White House press secretary contested the numbers and said the crowd was the largest ever at an inauguration.

But photos released by the National Park Service from Trump’s ceremony compared to Obama’s first inauguration in 2009 show a marked difference in the amount of people in the National Mall.

Estimates put the audience at Obama’s swearing-in at 1.8 million people.

The numbers for Trump are a sore point of contention.

At Saturday’s press briefing in the White House, Sean Spicer said mats placed on the grass caused a visual trick that emphasized gaps in the crowd.

“This was the first time in our nation’s history that floor coverings have been used to protect the grass on the Mall,” he said, mentioning the white mats. “That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual.”

But photos from Obama’s 2013 inaugural ceremony show mats protecting the grass in the Mall.

Later Saturday, the National Park Service did a mea culpa on Twitter.

“We regret the mistaken RTs from our account yesterday and look forward to continuing to share the beauty and history of our parks with you,” it said.

Asked on CNN about Spicer’s disputing the facts, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said Trump’s mouthpiece should have resigned rather than be forced by Trump or White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus to provide false facts.

“He should have resigned rather than go out and take the podium,” he said.",https://nypost.com/2017/01/22/trump-administration-disputes-crowd-numbers-at-inauguration/
New York Post,Brett Kavanaugh picked for SCJ,Brett Kavanaugh is an excellent pick for the Supreme Court,"Once again staying true to his campaign promises, President Trump just nominated Brett Kavanaugh as his pick to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. It’s an excellent choice — though the coming wave of fear-mongering may hide that fact for a while.

Judge Kavanaugh, 53, is widely seen as one of the top legal minds of his generation — so much so that now-Justice Elena Kagan recruited him to teach at Harvard Law, where students across the spectrum rave about him. Though firmly committed to interpreting the Constitution as written, he’s no ideologue — which is why Sen. Ted Cruz and other hard-rightists had been urging Trump to pick someone else.

But now Democrats will proceed with their preset strategy for fighting any Trump picks — charging that confirmation guarantees the end of Roe v. Wade and ObamaCare.

Which is nonsense: Chief Justice John Roberts, who’s set to be the new swing vote on the court, has already joined the four liberal justices to save ObamaCare once, and all indications are that he’s unwilling to reverse Roe or any other precedent more than four decades old. (For that matter, the only justice who clearly favors junking Roe is Clarence Thomas.).

No, what has Democrats despairing is the prospect of a Supreme Court that won’t create new progressive “rights” that even liberal majorities in Congress don’t dare pass as legislation.

But no high court nomination is a sure thing these days. Lefty activists are even now diving through Kavanaugh’s record (and even his trash) in hopes of finding something that will lose him a Republican vote or two — which would leave it up to a handful of Democratic senators facing re-election this fall in pro-Trump states.

Above all, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will try to play out the clock, pushing to delay any confirmation vote until after Election Day, when his odds of defeating the nominee might improve.

It’s up to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the White House to make sure Democrats’ hysterical games don’t derail a first-rate nominee.",https://nypost.com/2018/07/09/brett-kavanaugh-is-an-excellent-pick-for-the-supreme-court/
New York Post,Area 51 Raid,Military apologizes for threatening to launch stealth bomber at ‘Storm Area 51’ event,"The US military has apologized for threatening to launch a stealth bomber on young conspiracy theorists planning to storm Area 51.

The Defense Visual Information Distribution Service tweeted a photo late Friday of dozens of military men and women standing at attention in uniform in front of a B-2 stealth bomber.

“The last thing #Millennials will see if they attempt the #area51raid today,” the tweet threatened against anyone planning to storm the Arizona military base long rumored to house government secrets on aliens and UFOs.

The backlash was quick and sparked an official apology on Saturday.

“Last night a DVIDSHUB employee posted a Tweet that in NO WAY supports the stance of the Department of Defense,” the unit tweeted. “It was inappropriate and we apologize for this mistake.”

More than 2 million people had signed up to “see them aliens” with the viral “Storm Area 51” event, but officials say that at most 1,500 actually showed.

New York Post,George Floyd Death,Here’s everything we know about the death of George Floyd,"It was a routine police call for a run-of-the-mill crime — someone passing a bogus $20 bill at a deli.

But the ensuing death of unarmed black man George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis cops, and the resulting riots, have once again forced a divided nation into a bitter self-reckoning.

The cops involved were axed and President Trump himself has pledged an expedient investigation by federal law enforcement — but that has done little to quell searing outrage that’s lit up social media, left buildings at ground zero in Minneapolis torched and necessitated the Minnesota National Guard.

It all started when restaurant bouncer and aspiring commercial driver Floyd, 46, tried to buy groceries.

Floyd — a Houston native who had previous scrapes with the law and moved to the Twin Cities to start fresh about six years ago — went to the Cup Foods on Chicago Avenue South around 8 p.m. for the food run.

That’s around the time cops got a call from a store clerk that there was a “forgery in progress” — someone was trying to pay for groceries with a counterfeit $20 bill, a non-violent offense.

Surveillance footage from a nearby restaurant shows police arriving shortly after 8 p.m. and approaching a black minivan where Floyd is sitting with two other people.

Two officers walk up to the vehicle, its passenger door already open, and one shines a flashlight inside.

The second officer approaches Floyd and tells him to get out of the vehicle, prompting a brief struggle before Floyd exits the vehicle. Meanwhile, the passenger and a woman sitting in the back seat are seen getting out of the minivan.

Moments later, Floyd is seen, hands cuffed behind his back, being led to the side of a building by the two cops.

Floyd appears to be speaking to the officers but does not appear to resist.

A second police vehicle arrives as Floyd is escorted across the street to a waiting patrol car.

One surveillance video from across the street shows him stumbling and falling as the two officers lead him to the waiting squad car, according to footage obtained by KMSP-TV.

Bodycam video taken by a responding Minneapolis Park Police officer shows two other officers interviewing witnesses near the scene.

The video is heavily redacted and largely muted, but it appears the two individuals being questioned were the man and the woman who were in the van with Floyd.

What happens next is still uncertain — but the next time Floyd is seen on video is a viral clip shot by bystander Darnella Frazier, which shows Floyd already pinned down by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, a white cop seen pressing his knee into the back of Floyd’s neck while he lies face-down in handcuffs.

Chauvin had been the subject of 10 prior conduct complaints over his 19 years on the force but had never faced disciplinary action.

In the span of nearly four minutes, Floyd can be heard telling police at least a dozen times that he can’t breathe and asking Chauvin to take his knee off his neck — as bystanders, including the grocery clerk who initially called 911, plead with the officers to let Floyd get up.

“Please, I can’t breathe,” he said.

“Get up, get in the car,” one of the cops is heard saying while Floyd remains pinned down by Chauvin.

“I will, I can’t move,” Floyd responds.

He then stops moving altogether.

Police called EMTs around 8:30 p.m. and they arrived in six minutes to find an unconscious and unresponsive Floyd, according to Hennepin County Healthcare EMS Chief Marty Scheerer.

Paramedics and police eventually flipped Floyd over while he was still cuffed, placed him on a gurney and into an ambulance, where a responder released his hands.

Their decision to “load and go,” rather than triage Floyd on the spot, was likely based on their race against time, Scheerer said, adding that responders were likely unaware of how severe the situation had become.

Despite medical officials reportedly spending an hour trying to revive Floyd, he was pronounced dead at a local hospital at 9:25 p.m.

Police initially claimed that he “suffered a medical episode while struggling with officers,” but Frazier’s video soon put the lie to that claim.

“They killed him right in front of Cup Foods over south on 38th and Chicago,” the 17-year-old later said on Facebook. “No type of sympathy.”

The following day, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, visibly enraged by footage of the incident, announced at a press conference with Police Chief Maderia Arradondo that all four officers involved had been fired.

“Four responding MPD officers involved in the death of George Floyd have been terminated,” Frey said on Twitter. “This is the right call.”

In a separate tweet Tuesday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the incident “sickening.”

“The lack of humanity in this disturbing video is sickening,” Walz wrote. “We will get answers and seek justice.”

Frey lashed out again Wednesday, calling on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to arrest Chauvin, something a spokesman said Freeman’s office is “discussing.”

Meanwhile, the FBI announced that it would investigate the incident in a joint probe with state authorities. And Trump on Wednesday pledged that the feds would conduct an “expedited” investigation.

“At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation,” he tweeted.

On Thursday, Frey followed up by arguing that Floyd “would be alive today if he were white.”

Angry protesters nonetheless took to the streets of Minneapolis, targeting local stores and a police precinct in the city.

Outrage over the case spilled over into the sports world, with NBA stars LeBron James and Steph Curry taking to social media to express anger over Floyd’s death.

James posted side-by-side images on Instagram of Chauvin pinning Floyd and former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem before a San Francisco 49ers game — his high-profile protest of police brutality against black Americans.

“This…. Is Why,” the post said in explaining Kap’s protest.

Former NBA star Stephen Jackson, a friend of Lloyd’s thanks to their striking physical similarities, said he was devastated by his death.

“I jumped up, screamed, scared my daughter — almost broke my hand punching stuff because I was so mad,” the 42-year-old former Net told NBC’s “Today.” “It just destroyed me, and I haven’t been the same since I seen it.”

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also chimed in during his daily coronavirus press conference Thursday, calling Floyd’s death “frightening.”

“If I was a prosecutor, I would look at that case from the first moment,” said Cuomo, a former state attorney general and Manhattan prosecutor. “There is a criminal case there.”

Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, provided more personal commentary on the case on CNN Thursday when asked about the continuing protests.

“I want everybody to be peaceful right now, but people are torn and hurt because they’re tired of seeing black men die, constantly, over and over again,” he said.

“And I understand, and I see why a lot of people doing a lot of different things around the world. I don’t want them to lash out like this,” he added. “But I can’t stop people right now, because they have pain. They have the same pain I feel.”

“I want everything to be peaceful, but I can’t make everybody be peaceful.”

New York Post,January 6th,DC protests: How a mob of rioters took the Capitol building by storm,"The fervent protests surrounding the 2020 US election reached an ugly head Wednesday afternoon — but it had been steadily brewing for weeks and its implications could last for years.

The prospect of a huge gathering in Washington, D.C., was first revealed by President Trump as far back as Dec. 19, as he continued to deny losing the election to Joe Biden.

“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!” he tweeted of the protest to mark the day Biden’s win would be certified.

So, after weeks of hype, by 6 a.m. Wednesday thousands had already gathered around the Capitol for what was touted as the “Save America Rally.”

A “notable number” were already wearing bulletproof vests and helmets, Politico noted.

At 10 a.m., Trump’s attorney, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, rallied the crowds by saying he was “willing to stake [his] reputation” on election fraud.

“And if we’re wrong, we will be made fools of,” he said. “But if we’re right, a lot of them will go to jail. So let’s have trial by combat.”

Just before noon, the president addressed the crowds in a speech that lasted more than an hour.

“And after this, we’re going to walk down there, and I’ll be there with you, we’re going to walk down … to the Capitol and we are going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,” he said to cheers, although he did not walk with them as promised.

Lawmakers gathered in the House chamber around 1 p.m. to finally certify Biden’s election win — with rioters clashing with police outside the Capitol building soon after it started.

By 1:10 p.m., protesters had pulled down barriers facing the West Front of the Capitol.

Under threat of a siege, police ordered an evacuation of the Library of Congress, the Madison Building and Cannon House Office Building just before 1:30 p.m.

Within minutes, Trump supporters storm the Statuary Hall, a room that separates the House and Senate, heading towards the House and Senate.

At 1:40 p.m., DC Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a 12-hour curfew in the capital starting from 6 p.m. as the threat of violence heightened.

Just before 2:15 p.m., horrifying images and video started emerging of rioters scaling the walls of the Capitol complex and charging past lines of clearly outnumbered cops.

They attacked cops “with metal pipes, discharged chemical irritants and took up other weapons against our officers,” Steven Sund, the Capitol Police chief, would say later. “They were determined to enter into the Capitol Building by causing great damage.”

Lawmakers were then evacuated from the Chamber as rioters started smashing windows and ripping open doors as they were seen roaming Statuary Hall, carrying flags and chanting about election fraud.

Many insisted that they had every right to be there because it was “our house,” belonging to the American people.

Trump broke his silence at 2:38 p.m., tweeting, “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!”

Previous 1 of 5 Next Supporters of President Trump clash with police at the Capitol yesterday.

Just before 2:43 p.m., some of the most alarming images emerged — of police drawing their guns at the entrance to the House Chamber as rioters try to smash their way in.

Some of the mob made their way to the dais, posing for photos as terrified politicians escaped wearing breathing masks and hoods.

Just before 3 p.m., an officer shot Air Force vet Ashli Babbitt as video showed her trying to climb through into a protected area — one of four fatalities during the day of carnage.

By now, the mob was running rampant — trashing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office and smashing windows and ripping apart signs.

At 3:35 p.m., Vice President Mike Pence — one of those rushed to safety — tweeted that “the violence and destruction taking place at the US Capitol Must Stop and it Must Stop Now.”

“Those involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” he vowed.

By 3:51 p.m., DC’s entire National Guard — about 1,100 troops — was mobilized to back up overwhelmed cops.

Trump released a video telling his supporters to “go home in peace” — while mostly concentrating on their shared “pain” from having the election stolen from them.

In a follow-up message, he told the “great patriots” that they would “remember this day forever!”

While the curfew kicked in at 6 p.m., hundreds of rioters remained in the area for hours — before lawmakers finally returned to the Chamber at 8 p.m. to ratify Biden’s election.

Officials later revealed that three others — one woman and two men — died from “medical emergencies” during the carnage, while at least 14 officers were injured.

Despite the devastation to the hallowed halls of government, an initial tally showed just 52 people had been arrested, soon drawing ire from lawmakers and political commentators.

Of those, most were for breaking the curfew, while others faced weapons charges.

Police also confirmed at an evening press conference that pipe bombs had been found at the headquarters of both the DNC and RNC, and officers also found a cooler packed with Molotov Cocktails.

Pence used the social site again at 8:39 p.m., this time to “condemn the violence” in the “strongest possible terms.”

“We grieve the loss of life in these hallowed halls, as well as the injuries suffered by those who defended our Capitol today,” he wrote.

On Thursday morning, lawmakers were demanding answers on how police had been so easily overwhelmed — as well as many calling for Trump to be removed from office.

A slew of Trump’s staffers started resigning over the scandal, one that his predecessor Barack Obama would forever be remembered “as a moment of great dishonor and shame for our nation.”

Trump, meanwhile, lost his most powerful voice — with Twitter locking him out for at least 12 hours, while Facebook and Instagram blocked him “indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks.”

The riotous mob also quickly failed in its objectives. Many of the Senators who had planned to object to Biden’s election win dropped those plans once lawmakers finally sat again, and Biden’s win was certified just after 3:40 a.m.

Within minutes, Trump said there would be an “orderly transition” of power.

The threat of violence, meanwhile, continues — and DC ordered its 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew to continue for another 15 days.

“The violent attack on the US Capitol was unlike any I have ever experienced in my 30 years in law enforcement here in Washington, DC,” Chief of Police Steven Sund said Thursday.

“Make no mistake — these mass riots were not First Amendment activities; they were criminal, riotous behavior.”

The Wall Street Journal,Hurricane Katrina,After the Storm,"Katrina is a huge and historic story. The human cost, the financial cost, the rendering uninhabitable of a great and fabled American city--all of it amazing. A quick look at the good, the bad, and the let's-shoot-them-now.

The governors. Political leadership in times of crisis is a delicate thing. You have to be frank about the fix you're in without being demoralizing. You have to seem confident without seeming out of touch with reality. You have to be human without indulging all your very human emotions. Rudy Giuliani set the modern standard on 9/11, and in a way that is not remarked upon. All his public statements were brilliantly specific. He told you exactly what resources were on their way to do what and where and why; he told you the No. 4 subway had been diverted west and then south until 11 a.m. Saturday; he told exactly which blocks were closed off and for how long; he told you New York would come back and then he told you why and how. His leadership was a masterpiece of specificity. That he had the facts at his command left people feeling: Thank God, someone's in charge, I can take care of me while he takes care of the city. That's what people want in a time of crisis.

Mississippi's Gov. Haley Barbour came closest to the Giuliani model. We are friendly acquaintances; I knew him years ago when he was a political operative in Washington. I'm frankly surprised he's turned into a leader, but he has. From the beginning of the hurricane drama Mr. Barbour came close to Mr. Giuliani's specificity. In news conferences he laid out with breadth and precision the facts of the Mississippi coastal devastation. He had to keep telling the press and the public that there would be more dead than they understood, a delicate thing to have to do. He did it with candor and transparency but no defeat. He had command of what facts were known. His face was shocked and sad, but he never looked beaten; he referred on ""Larry King Live"" to the rebuilding of the coast as if it were a foregone conclusion but one that will take massive work. He seemed straight, unillusioned, human. Watch Mr. Barbour. If he continues like this, he's going to become a significant national figure.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122487570244867421

The Wall Street Journal,Swine Flu,"H1N1 Cases Vastly Underreported, CDC Says","WASHINGTON -- The number of confirmed cases of H1N1 flu from April to July represents just 2% of the actual people who were infected with the virus, according to a report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

The report, posted to the agency's Web site, says the number of people infected with H1N1 flu from April to July likely was between 1.8 million and 5.7 million, much higher than the 43,677 confirmed cases. The paper also said the virus hospitalized 9,000 to 21,000 people during the same period.

The study shows the prevalence of the virus is more widespread than originally reported. The CDC and World Health Organization in July stopped tracking individual cases because they acknowledged doing so was difficult.

In recent weeks, government health officials have instead been describing the scope of the virus by saying it is widespread in 46 states. The authors of the study say the report may help health officials plan for a subsequent wave of the epidemic in the fall and winter months.

Steve Brozak, an analyst and president of WBB Securities LLC, said the report shows there are just ""too many variables"" for the government to track individual cases, and suggests the government can't be held accountable if the disease becomes more or less widespread than health officials estimate.

""Now there's just no way you can say statistically we should have done this or done that,"" Mr. Brozak said.

The report says underreporting may occurs for a handful of reasons, including because not everyone gets tested and the quality of tests varies.

The authors of the study created a model to estimate cases based off the number of confirmed reports and other studies, such as the rate at which people with the season flu seek help.

The study estimates that for every confirmed case, there was likely a median of 79 actual people infected with the virus. Using the same model, the authors estimate about 800 people died from the virus during the same time frame.

The Wall Street Journal,Area 51 Raid,What’s Really Going On at Area 51: Maybe the Biggest UFO Party on Earth,"RACHEL, Nev.— Glenn Kaminsky put up a booth at the recent Bigfoot Daze festival in Willow Creek, Calif., to promote an invasion of Area 51, or at least a party in the same desert neighborhood.

The secretive Nevada military facility, long suspected of hiding extraterrestrials and their space ships, is ground zero for a coming assembly of UFO enthusiasts seeking close encounters with fellow travelers.

“I think everybody in America is curious. What really goes on out there? What do they do at Area 51? Are there aliens there? I’d like to know,” said Mr. Kaminsky, 43 years old, of Humboldt County, Calif.

What started as a goof on Facebook this summer, “Storm Area 51: They Can’t Stop All of Us,” is edging closer to reality. The post tallied more than 2 million RSVPs. “Lets see them aliens,” it said. The mystery is how many will show. Regardless, the post spawned two festivals that begin Sept. 20.

Mr. Kaminsky launched his own Facebook group, Camp Storm Area 51, to coordinate rides and supplies. “I do believe in aliens,” he said. “How could you not?”

He might run into Noemi Barajas, a 31-year-old tattoo artist, who also plans to go. As a teenager, Ms. Barajas spotted a UFO the size of a compact car hovering outside her house in Anaheim, Calif. “I would like to meet someone out there that had an encounter as well,” she said.

The region’s two businesses are trying to make the most of it. The Alien Research Center in Hiko, Nev., a roadside attraction and souvenir shop, sells everything from plastic little green men to Tequila bottles shaped like the heads of space aliens. Owner George Harris is hosting “Storm Area 51 Base Camp,” featuring UFO lectures and a telescope. He is preparing for thousands to descend.

The “Alienstock” festival opens the same day about 40 miles away, at Little A’Le’Inn, the only motel and restaurant in Area 51’s orbit. The phone has been ringing off the hook with callers too late to book one of the motel’s 13 rooms, said Connie West, the owner. Over the past 30 years, she has seen the ups and downs of UFO interest. “This is my livelihood,” she said.

Ms. West has ordered portable toilets for what she hopes will be paying customers for her campsites in Rachel, Nev., population in the double digits.

Rob Bowman, a 48-year-old pizza restaurant owner in San Saba, Texas, said he planned to set up camp on Bureau of Land Management property, after making the 20-hour drive with his 17-year-old son and two brothers-in-law.

Mr. Bowman is drawn to Area 51 the way people flocked to a remote butte in the 1977 extraterrestrial movie “Close Encounters of the Third Kind.”

“They had no idea why they had to get to that mountain, but they felt like they had to go. I feel like I have to go. It’s nothing really to do with the aliens,” he said. “…Maybe the aliens have something to do with it.”

He also could use a break from his workaday life. “I don’t do anything fun. I have a restaurant. My whole life is the restaurant,” Mr. Bowman said. “So, just to do something wild and crazy. That’s probably one of the real reasons.”

Local, state and federal officials are in a state of alert. The county sheriff’s department has a dozen deputies to cover 1,200 square miles, and some experience tracking alien-seekers lost in the desert.

“We’ve had everything from the curiosity-seekers to the UFO people to ‘I’m paying for this place, I want to know what’s there,’” Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee said. “People who are just average Joes, to families, to a lot of foreigners.”

Eric Vaughan, 45, of Portland, Ore., said he planned to bring 400 alien-theme T-shirts and 3,200 bottles of water to sell at Alienstock. He said he believes in distant forms of life but doubts any have visited Earth.

“It really is for me more about the belief and the hope that there’s other life out there…rather than trying to meet aliens or anything like that,” Mr. Vaughan said. “I want to meet other people and make some friends.”

Area 51 was the Air Force site for developing the U-2 spy plane in the 1950s. The Central Intelligence Agency first acknowledged the facility in 2013.

Curious civilians are still ordered to keep out of the Nevada Test and Training Range, commonly referred to as Area 51. “When an unauthorized person accesses a military installation they are detained until they can be turned over to the appropriate law-enforcement authorities,” an Air Force spokeswoman said.

Christopher Bader, a Chapman University sociology professor who studies how people view the paranormal, said many are turning away from traditional religion to a patchwork of beliefs that might include aliens, ghosts or Bigfoot.

“We’re facing a crisis on how do we assess information, how do we assess evidence, what is good information and what is bad information,” Mr. Bader said. “That’s a real crisis of truth that the paranormal steps right into.”

A third of Americans in a recent Gallup poll said some UFO sightings have been alien spaceships visiting Earth, while 60% believed they could be explained by human activity or natural phenomenon.

Steve and Glenda Medlin, longtime cattle ranchers, said their mailbox had stood alongside state route 375, on a 98-mile stretch officially designated the Extraterrestrial Highway. Visitors began stuffing it with letters to aliens, and it became known in the UFO community as “the black mailbox.”

The Medlins, patience worn thin, eventually removed it and got their mail delivered to the house. A stranger put up another black mailbox in its place.

Now comes an army of prospective late-summer campers seeking answers.

“If the people are coming from back East or wherever the hell they’re coming from, they don’t know what this desert is like,” Ms. Medlin said.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-really-going-on-at-area-51-maybe-the-biggest-ufo-party-on-earth-11567783089

The Wall Street Journal,Trump Inauguration,Donald Trump’s Inauguration Brings in Over 30 Million Viewers,"An audience of 30.6 million people tuned in to watch Donald Trump’s inauguration as president, falling short of the number of people who watched Barack Obama’s first swearing in eight years ago, according to Nielsen.

In his 16-minute-and-12-second address, Mr. Trump indicted the political system and promised a populist “new vision” for the country, focusing on issues such as infrastructure, crime and terrorism. “From this day forward it is going to be only America First, America First,” Mr. Trump said.

Viewership for the events and Mr. Trump’s speech, which was aired across all major broadcast and cable networks, was up from the 20.6 million who watched Mr. Obama get sworn in for a second time four years ago.

But Mr. Obama’s first inauguration in 2009 scored a larger television audience, with 37.8 million tuning in, according to Nielsen.

The ratings for Mr. Trump were on par with George W. Bush’s first inauguration in 2001 and Bill Clinton’s first in 1993, which brought in 29 million and 29.7 million viewers, respectively. Ronald Reagan had 41.8 million viewers in 1981.

Events this political season, particularly the debates, generated big audiences for TV networks. The first battle between Mr. Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton brought in 84 million viewers, the most ever for a presidential debate.

On Saturday, TV coverage shifted between Mr. Trump’s visits to the Washington National Cathedral and Central Intelligence Agency headquarters and the demonstrations at Women’s March events across the country.

Ratings have been a consistent interest of Mr. Trump’s. He has criticized TV networks for using unfair coverage to boost their ratings figures and bragged about his own ability to bring in big TV numbers.

Nielsen’s figures don't factor in live-streaming across the web, an increasingly popular way for viewers to watch coverage of big events. Live feeds from media companies such as the New York Times, CNN, BBC News and The Wall Street Journal aired on Facebook Live, and PBS streamed coverage on Twitter, for example.

The Wall Street Journal,Obama Elected,Obama Sweeps to Historic Victory,"b'WASHINGTON -- Sen. Barack Obama was elected the nation\'s first African-American president, defeating Sen. John McCain decisively Tuesday as citizens surged to the polls in a presidential race that climaxed amid the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\r\n\r\n""Change has come,"" Sen. Obama told a huge throng of cheering supporters in Chicago at a midnight rally.\r\n\r\nIn his first speech as victor, Sen. Obama catalogued the challenges ahead. ""The greatest of a lifetime,"" he said, ""two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century."" (See the full text of Obama\'s speech.)\r\n\r\nHe added, ""There are many who won\'t agree with every decision or policy I make as president, and we know that government can\'t solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face.\'\'\r\n\r\nThe culmination of the epic two-year campaign marks a historic moment in a nation that since its founding has struggled with racial divisions. It also ushers in a period of dominance for Democrats in Washington for the first time since the early years of President Bill Clinton\'s first term. With Tuesday\'s elections, Sen. Obama\'s party will control both houses of Congress as well as the White House, setting the scene for Democrats to push an ambitious agenda from health care to financial regulation to ending the war in Iraq.\r\n\r\nIn becoming the U.S.\'s 44th president, Illinois Sen. Obama, 47 years old, defeated Arizona Sen. McCain, 72, a veteran lawmaker and Vietnam War hero. Despite a reputation for bucking his own party, Sen. McCain could not overcome a Democratic tide, which spurred voters to take a risk on a candidate with less than four years of national political experience. Sen. Obama is the first northern Democrat elected president since John F. Kennedy in 1960.\r\n\r\nSen. McCain conceded the election to Sen. Obama, congratulating him and pledging to help bring unity to the country. Speaking from outside the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Sen. McCain told his supporters: ""It\'s natural tonight to feel some disappointment. Though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours."" (Read more on McCain\'s concession.)\r\n\r\nSen. McCain was defeated in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Mexico and New Hampshire, swing states he was hoping to secure for the Republican column.\r\n\r\nAccording to a preliminary tally, Sen. Obama led the race with 349 electoral votes versus 162 for Sen. McCain; 270 were needed to win.\r\n\r\nAlso elected, as vice president: Joe Biden, the veteran senator from Delaware who has promised to help Sen. Obama steer his agenda through Congress.\r\n\r\nSen. Obama\'s victory was built on record fund raising and a vast national campaign network. It remade the electoral map that had held fast for eight years. He overwhelmed reliable Democratic strongholds in the Northeast and West Coast. He won big in the industrial Midwest and contested fiercely in areas of traditional Republican strength. He won Virginia, the first time a Democratic candidate had taken the state since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. And he finally wrested Florida and Ohio from the GOP, two states that had bedeviled his party in the last two elections.\r\n\r\nWatershed Moment\r\nThe president-elect will enter office with a long policy wish list that includes ending the war in Iraq, implementing a near-universal health-insurance plan and finding alternatives to Middle Eastern oil. All this will have to be carried out amid record budget deficits, a looming crisis in Social Security and Medicare spending as the baby-boom generation retires and fears that the nation is on the edge of a deep recession.\r\n\r\nDemocrats have touted the prospect of a big sweep not just as a partisan conquest but as an ideological turning point, one that could reverse the last great shift in 1980, when Ronald Reagan ushered in a period dominated by tax-cutting conservatism and muscular foreign policy.\r\n'",https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122581133077197035
The Wall Street Journal,London Olympics,Last Call in London,"b'Another summer, another Summer Olympics. It\'s been a wild few weeks in London, from our initial fawning over the Queen\'s corgis to Sunday night\'s pop star-studded journey through the British arts. In between, there were enough highlights and talking reels to tide us over until Rio.\r\n\r\n\r\nNike\'s next windbreaker: the American flag.\r\nASSOCIATED PRESS\r\nWe\'ll remember the way Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps cemented their legendary statuses with a string of record-breaking, competition-negating performances. We\'ll remember the fierce U.S. women\'s gymnastics team, filled with enough potential stars to make every Hollywood agent\'s head spin. We\'ll remember our amazingly accurate medal projections. We\'ll remember Hope Solo and Abby Wambach breaking ground on a come-from-behind women\'s soccer gold medal, the first female Saudi competitors and improbably enough, a badminton scandal. That\'s without mentioning Andy Murray, Oscar Pistorious, Bryshon Nellum, Shin A-lam and many, many more memorable faces who flooded our television screens. After we\'ve remembered all that, we can remember it all over again.\r\n\r\n""No one expected London to top what was the largess of Beijing and yet, with grace and panache fully fitting of the British people, the 2012 Games delivered. And then some,"" Bryan Fischer writes for CBS Sports. ""Faster, higher, stronger, the past two weeks surely lived up to the Olympic motto. It didn\'t try and top anything, rather it lived in the present and let the athletic achievements and special moments flow naturally from one day to the next. Over 16 days the world watched and each night went to sleep amazed.""\r\n\r\nThe final Olympic day wasn\'t without a final thrilling event. As expected, the U.S. men\'s basketball team played in the final for its second straight gold medal. The competition, though, was much stiffer than expected, as Spain came shockingly close to pulling off the upset. Despite some early foul trouble, the Spaniards hung within a few points for most of the game, in no small thanks to the way Pau Gasol was able to take advantage of an undersized American frontcourt. But as will happen when the NBA\'s six top scorers get playing time, there were just too many players available to get hot. Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James took turns bolstering the slim lead, and by the end, the U.S. was firmly in front for a 107-100 victory. ""[The Spaniards] believed in miracles, which enabled them to withstand a torrid assault of seven U.S. threes in the opening period, but the American stars believed in themselves more,"" writes Sports Illustrated\'s Ian Thomsen. ""Their depth and togetherness and peaking talents overwhelmed the technical advantages of length and institutional teamwork that the Spaniards had developed over their decade of playing together. Really, it came down to this: From the beginning, the Spaniards imagined they could win, but the Americans knew they would win in the end.""\r\n\r\nPlenty of questions await the program. Coach Mike Krzyzewski is expected to retire after compiling a 62-1 international record. There\'s a debate over whether the pro-player format will be scrapped in favor of an under-23 team -- the preferred choice of the NBA ownership that would like to see some financial return rather than risk. (First, they\'ll have to pitch it to the players.) It\'ll be enough to talk about for the next four years, as the Olympic cycle repeats.\r\n\r\nHyperbolic anticipation has stymied a great many careers in sports, if not outright ended them. But after a performance like Rory McIlroy\'s all-out domination of the PGA Championship, it\'s sort of impossible to apply the brakes. A year after winning his first major, the 23-year-old burst through with a 13-under-par and an eight-stroke margin of victory -- the latter of which set a new record. Which means no one else was remotely close, and the gulf of distance already has columnists salivating over the golf legends McIlroy might resemble at this early stage of his career. We\'ll wait a little longer before calling him the Next Anything and simply appreciate the literally unparalleled performance that will go a long way toward inaugurating McIlroy as golf\'s biggest threat.\r\n\r\n""No, we\'re looking at the best golfer in the world. McIlroy, who moved to the top spot in the Official World Golf Ranking with his win, went from king-in-waiting to the new king of golf on Sunday,"" writes Yahoo\'s Jonathan Wall. ""It would be a huge deal, but the thing is, this is what we always expected from him.""\r\n\r\nBemoaning the state of print journalism is not typical territory for the Fix, but it\'s really sort of impossible to imagine a modern climate in which a summer intern could be given the opportunities to eventually become a newspaper\'s premier reporter for 44 long years. (Namely because newspapers might not be around in 44 years.) But it did happen, which is what make Bob Ryan\'s career longevity so remarkable. For longer than both your Fixers have been alive, Ryan was a staple in the Boston Globe as the definitive Celtics writer, burnishing his resume with the types of book deals and awards that get journalism students drooling. After announcing his retirement earlier this year, Ryan wrote a farewell letter in the Globe on Sunday explaining his reasons for leaving. It\'s a career that won\'t likely be replicated.\r\n\r\n""So why now? It\'s time; that\'s all. I\'ve covered the events I wanted to cover. I reached a goal with the Bruins\' Stanley Cup run in 2011 to have covered championships in all four primary pro sports. I\'ve covered 29 Final Fours. London has been my 11th Olympics. I even did a dog show. I am fulfilled,"" he writes. ""But there is something else. I occasionally come across some things I wrote years ago, and I say to myself, ""I did that?""

The Wall Street Journal,Boston Marathon Bombings,Deadly Blasts Rock Boston,"b'BOSTON\xe2\x80\x94Two deadly explosions ripped through a crowd at the Boston Marathon on Monday, killing at least three people and injuring about 140, once again raising the specter of terrorism on American soil.\r\n\r\nAt about 2:50 p.m., some three hours after the winners had crossed the finish line but while thousands more runners still were on the streets, two bombs exploded 50 to 100 yards apart near the course\'s end in the city\'s crowded Back Bay section, Boston Police said.\r\n\r\nPanicked spectators fled the scene as smoke from the blasts filled the air, sirens wailed and exhausted, disoriented runners and families raced to find one another amid the mayhem.\r\n\r\nPresident Barack Obama, in a brief televised address, said he would put the full resources of the government behind the investigation.

""Make no mistake.

Those who hadn\'t were diverted from the course by police about a half mile from the end, witnesses said. Some 23,000 people had started the marathon, estimated the Boston Athletic Association, its organizer.\r\n\r\nThom Kenney, a 43-year-old Army veteran who recently returned from Afghanistan, had just crossed the finish line when the explosions rang out. ""Most of the people were looking back at the first explosion, wondering what it was, when the second explosion went off,"" he said. ""When that went off, we all started calling our families as fast as we could.""\r\n\r\nThe explosions ""sounded like an IED\xe2\x80\x94that was the first reaction that I had,"" he said, referring to the improvised explosive devices used in Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nPolice initially reported a third explosion at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, about six miles away, then said it had been a fire in a mechanical room. But fearing more explosions or other events, authorities urged people to stay inside and avoid large crowds.\r\n\r\nThe blasts temporarily halted the city\'s transportation system as well as flights. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered flights bound for Boston\'s Logan International Airport to remain at their original airports until late afternoon.\r\n\r\nHospitals around the city were flooded with victims bearing a range of injuries.\r\n\r\n""These are very high-force, high-impact injuries so they cause a lot of damage to tissue and to bone,"" said Ron Walls, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital. Shrapnel embedded in some patients\' skin seemed to be objects from the street, not from any explosive device, he said.\r\n\r\nA Massachusetts General spokeswoman said injuries there ran the gamut from ""cuts and scrapes to amputations.""\r\n\r\nAt Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dr. Stephen Epstein, attending physician in the emergency department, said X-rays of patients showed metal balls that appeared to be ball bearings. ""They look like BBs,"" he said, adding that the balls were distinct from the shrapnel thrown up from debris on the street. Dr. Epstein said some people are at risk of losing limbs.\r\n\r\nBoston Police Commissioner Edward Davis called the bombs ""powerful devices"" but declined to describe them further. ""There was no specific intelligence that anything was going to happen,"" Mr. Davis said at a news conference.\r\n\r\nA Justice Department official said Attorney General Eric Holder directed agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to investigate. The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul (R., Texas), said that ""if this is in fact a malicious attack, those responsible will be held accountable.\'\'\r\n\r\nBrent Cunningham, 46, had traveled from Sitka, Alaska, to run in the marathon. ""We heard two explosions, and I thought, \'that had a 9/11 feel to it,\' "" he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Cunningham had finished the race and was walking in Boston Common with his family when the blasts hit. ""It wasn\'t until we heard sirens, then we knew something had happened.""\r\n\r\nBeth Wolniewicz, a 46-year-old Chicago resident, said she had finished the race about three minutes before the initial blast. ""I saw the first explosion. I never saw the second one go off,"" she said. ""It was loud but more staggering was the velocity of the smoke. It was rising really quickly.""\r\n\r\nPaul Thompson, a spectator who is a sports cardiologist, has researched and published extensively about the health implications of running the Boston Marathon. Driving away from the bloody scene near the finish line Monday, Dr. Thompson couldn\'t speak without crying.\r\n\r\n""For what? For what?"" said the 65-year-old. ""These people are totally innocent. They\'re not engaged in combat.""\r\n\r\nA 29-time finisher of the race who first witnessed it as a child at his father\'s knee, Dr. Thompson said he couldn\'t imagine the race ever being the same. ""Unequivocally, it will change these events. It will become less fun. Less of a party. I just can\'t tell you how terrible I think this is.""\r\n\r\nThe London Marathon is scheduled to take place this Sunday. In a statement released by the London Marathon Twitter account, Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent Julia Pendry said of the coming race, ""We will be reviewing our security arrangements in partnership with London Marathon.""\r\n\r\nOther cities across the country heightened security after the Boston explosions. New York Police Department officials activated emergency measures to protect ""hotels and other prominent locations"" in New York City, spokesman Paul Browne said Monday.

The Wall Street Journal,Russia Invades Ukraine,"Ukraine Accuses Russia of Invasion, West to Consider Sanctions","b'Kiev and its Western backers accused Moscow of sending Russian troops and armor to fight alongside rebels in eastern Ukraine, dimming hopes for a diplomatic solution to the crisis and prompting the U.S. and Europe to threaten new sanctions.\r\n\r\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko convened an emergency meeting of his security chiefs Thursday and vowed that ""Ukraine can defend itself.""\r\n\r\nHe dispatched troops to meet the Russian-backed advance as his government ordered the reinstatement of a draft this fall\xe2\x80\x94though it pledged not to send conscripts into the war zone.\r\n\r\nBut while officials in Kiev called on Western capitals for support, including military aid, the initial reaction from the U.S. and Europe included expressions of frustration with the Kremlin but no immediate action.\r\n\r\nPresident Barack Obama ruled out a U.S. military response but said that the escalating incursion into Ukraine would bring more costs for Moscow.\r\n\r\nMilitary equipment that NATO says Russia has in the region:\r\n\r\nInside Ukraine, operated by Russians or separatists: self-propelled artillery, air defense systems, tanks, armored vehicles, rocket launchers, armored personnel carriers.\r\nRussian equipment positioned in Russia, near the border: T-72 tanks; 153mm 2S19 self-propelled artillery; combat aircraft; armored personnel carriers.\r\n\r\nMilitary equipment that NATO says Russia has in the region:\r\n\r\nInside Ukraine, operated by Russians or separatists: self-propelled artillery, air defense systems, tanks, armored vehicles, rocket launchers, armored personnel carriers.\r\nRussian equipment positioned in Russia, near the border: T-72 tanks; 153mm 2S19 self-propelled artillery; combat aircraft; armored personnel carriers.\r\n\r\nMilitary equipment that NATO says Russia has in the region:\r\n\r\nInside Ukraine, operated by Russians or separatists: self-propelled artillery, air defense systems, tanks, armored vehicles, rocket launchers, armored personnel carriers.\r\nRussian equipment positioned in Russia, near the border: T-72 tanks; 153mm 2S19 self-propelled artillery; combat aircraft; armored personnel carriers.\r\n\r\nMilitary equipment that NATO says Russia has in the region:\r\n\r\nInside Ukraine, operated by Russians or separatists: self-propelled artillery, air defense systems, tanks, armored vehicles, rocket launchers, armored personnel carriers.\r\nRussian equipment positioned in Russia, near the border: T-72 tanks; 153mm 2S19 self-propelled artillery; combat aircraft; armored personnel carriers.\r\n\r\nWestern leaders have for months said a Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine would prompt harsher economic sanctions and international isolation on Russia. But President Obama has also made clear that the U.S. and its allies won\'t intervene militarily to stop Russian forces.\r\n\r\nKiev\'s military, underequipped and heavily reliant on poorly trained volunteer units, would be no match for a major force from Russia.\r\n\r\nIf threats of more Western sanctions failed to deter Moscow, Kiev would likely be forced to agree to a cease-fire that left the separatists\xe2\x80\x94and their sponsors in Russia\xe2\x80\x94in control of a substantial part of Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThat would be a dramatic setback for Mr. Poroshenko\'s pro-Western government and a severe blow to Ukraine\'s already-shrinking economy, as well as a threat to his ambitions for closer ties with the European Union and U.S.\r\n\r\nWestern nations have grown increasingly alarmed. Speaking before French ambassadors in Paris, President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande said any incursion by Russian troops inside Ukraine would be ""intolerable"" and warned that Moscow would expose itself to a new round of sanctions if it didn\'t respect the sovereignty of its western neighbor.\r\n\r\n""Russia cannot simultaneously aspire to be a world power in the 21st century and not play by the rules,"" the French president said.\r\n\r\nBut it is unclear how big an appetite European countries have for more sanctions on Russia, a major trading partner, with economies on the continent already slowing.\r\n\r\nThe EU had hoped that diplomatic efforts, which led to a meeting in Minsk, Belarus, on Tuesday between Messrs. Poroshenko and Putin, would lead to a negotiated settlement. But the latest developments made that prospect seem remote.\r\n\r\nAfter falling back before the advance in the southeast, Ukrainian troops are now digging in near the strategically important port city of Mariupol, which had been one of the first Kiev reclaimed from rebels earlier this year. The Russian news agency Interfax cited pro-Russian rebels as saying they will be taking the city ""in the coming days.""\r\n\r\nUkraine\'s security council said the assault on Novoazovsk on Wednesday was preceded by missile fire from across the Russian border, followed by the incursion of ""two columns of Russian military equipment.""\r\n\r\nThe council said Russian forces had taken control of Novoazovsk and surrounding villages, as well as villages further north, toward Donetsk.\r\n\r\nAt the main roadblock on the road east from Mariupol, a few dozen pro-Kiev soldiers and volunteers armed with rifles stood at the post of concrete blocks with two armored vehicles. They were digging trenches, but several despaired at what they said was lack of support, with no artillery or tanks to bolster their defensive position.\r\n\r\n""What can we do with rifles against tanks?"" asked one bearded fighter in his 20s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94James Marson, Philip Shishkin and Naftali Bendavid contributed to this article.\r\n\r\nWrite to James Marson at james.marson@wsj.com and Gregory L.

The Wall Street Journal,Trump Elected,"Donald Trump Elected President, Riding Populist Wave","b""Republican Donald Trump, a political novice who ran a nationalist campaign calling for restricting immigration and international trade, scored a stunning win to become the 45th president of the United States, defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton in one of the biggest upsets in U.S. political history.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump rolled to victory in a series of states that put him over the 270 electoral-vote threshold, ending a cliffhanger night of vote counting that capped the bitter, months long presidential contest.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump was declared winner in Wisconsin, one of many rust belt states that rallied behind him, he was declared the winner by the Associated Press. Mrs. Clinton called Mr. Trump to concede, he said at his victory rally.\r\n\r\nThe polls and political pundits gave Mr. Trump little chance of winning. But he gathered victories in state after state, running up extraordinary vote totals in rural areas and working-class counties, while big-city turnout fell short, including black voters that Democrat Hillary Clinton had counted on to carry her.\r\n\r\nIt was a stunning end to an election that provided a historic choice: selecting the first female president in U.S. history, taking the baton of leadership from the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first black president, or electing a political novice on the promise of radical change.\r\n\r\nThe long night of vote counting was an appropriate end to a campaign that had turned into one of the most unpredictable in modern politics. Heading into Election Day, Mrs. Clinton had enough states locked up, according to polls, that Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s narrow path required him to win just about every battleground state and pick up at least one Democratic-leaning state.\r\n\r\nIt was a stunning end to an election that provided a historic choice: selecting the first female president in U.S. history, taking the baton of leadership from the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first black president, or electing a political novice on the promise of radical change.\r\n\r\nThe long night of vote counting was an appropriate end to a campaign that had turned into one of the most unpredictable in modern politics. Heading into Election Day, Mrs. Clinton had enough states locked up, according to polls, that Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s narrow path required him to win just about every battleground state and pick up at least one Democratic-leaning state.\r\n\r\nAfter such a long and closely fought battle, the next president faces a deeply divided nation. Both candidates were viewed negatively by a majority of voters, polls showed. To many, the presidential election was seen as a choice between the lesser of two evils.\r\n\r\nCraig Joerres, 50 years old, of Waukesha, Wis., said he needed a glass of whiskey before voting Tuesday. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been such a stressful election season,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth parties had so much hate.\xe2\x80\x9d He said he voted for Mr. Trump to shake up Washington.\r\n\r\nLiliana Sanchez, age 29, said she voted for Mrs. Clinton, in part, because she was repelled by Mr. Trump.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a daughter who has a disability. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the way he talked about people who are disabled,\xe2\x80\x9d the Colorado woman said, referring to a campaign appearance that showed Mr. Trump seemingly mock a disabled reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m also, of course, a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the way he expressed himself about women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbout 130 million Americans were expected to cast ballots. At stake was not only the presidency, but a vacancy on the Supreme Court, as well as control of the Senate.\r\n\r\nAt least 47 million people cast ballots in early voting across such states as Arizona, Florida and Nevada, setting records. In Florida, more than six million people voted early\xe2\x80\x94a 35% increase from 2012. In North Carolina, about half of all registered voters cast ballots early, totaling more than 3 million.\r\n\r\nThrough mid-October, the two candidates and their allies spent about $1.4 billion on campaign operations and advertising to persuade American voters.\r\n\r\nBoth Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump voted Tuesday morning in their home state of New York, following a frantic spate of 11th hour campaigning in battleground states that spanned New Hampshire, Nevada, Florida and Michigan.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Clinton voted in Chappaqua, N.Y., she spoke of her chance to make history and the enormity of the task should she win.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know how much responsibility goes with this and so many people are counting on the outcome of this election, what it means for our country and I will do the very best I can if I\xe2\x80\x99m fortunate enough to win today,\xe2\x80\x9d she told reporters.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump projected confidence as he arrived to cast his vote at a public school in New York City. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very excited,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great opportunity. There is tremendous enthusiasm from everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe presidential campaign presented voters with a contrast of visions\xe2\x80\x94both about the state of the nation and where it should head next.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump spoke of a country in decline, burdened by illegal immigration, poor trade deals and terrorist threats. He labeled Mrs. Clinton as \xe2\x80\x9ccrooked.\xe2\x80\x9d He called for tax cuts and promised to repeal President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s health-care law.\r\n\r\nThe New York businessman said he would build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and send those living in the U.S. without permission back to their home countries.\r\n\r\nPreliminary exit polls on Tuesday showed that voters, by a nearly three-to-one margin, preferred offering illegal immigrants a path to legal status rather than conducting mass deportations; a solid majority opposed building the wall.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clinton, in contrast, embraced the health care law, along with economic improvements and social changes of the past eight years. After criticizing Mr. Trump for weeks, she sought to end the campaign on an optimistic note, asking voters to choose a \xe2\x80\x9chopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFaced with the chance to elect the first woman to the White House, many voters paid homage Tuesday to those who knocked down barriers in the fight for women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage in the early 1900s.\r\n\r\nHundreds of Clinton supporters made a pilgrimage to the gravesite of Susan B. Anthony, a prominent activist in the fight for women\xe2\x80\x99s right to vote. At a cemetery in Rochester, N.Y., people waited in long lines to pay their respects, plastering Ms. Anthony\xe2\x80\x99s tombstone with \xe2\x80\x9cI voted\xe2\x80\x9d stickers.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump also will leave his own stamp on political history. He mobilized millions of voters with a blunt challenge to the status quo and gave voice to the economic and political grievances of a struggling American middle class.\r\n\r\nThose are sentiments that have been brewing for years. But they emerged with surprising force behind Mr. Trump, who was dismissed as a TV celebrity when he first announced what seemed a quixotic candidacy.\r\n\r\nSpokesmen for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee on a call with reporters Tuesday said they were feeling good about the party\xe2\x80\x99s chances in the final hours of the election.\r\n\r\nThey touted the number of organizers they fielded Tuesday\xe2\x80\x94about 7,600, compared with 876 organizers who worked Election Day for Republican nominee Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s campaign in 2012.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a greater capacity for get-out-the-vote than any prior Republican effort,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chris Young, the RNC\xe2\x80\x99s field director.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump often complained of the political system being rigged, making unproven allegations during appearances that took a toll on voter confidence. Civil-rights groups and some conservative activists fanned out to polling locations on Tuesday to monitor voting. A coalition of groups also operated a national hotline to field voter questions and concerns.\r\n\r\nNo major voting issues were reported, beyond the usual long lines, late precinct openings and some machine breakdowns.\r\n\r\nJason Reid, 26 years old, also of Waukesha, said divisions in his family over the election run deep. He voted for Mrs. Clinton. His mother voted for Mr. Trump.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told me she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t voting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand then she sneaked out and secretly voted for Trump.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWrite to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com, Colleen McCain Nelson at colleen.nelson@wsj.com and Beth Reinhard at beth.reinhard@wsj.com\r\n\r\nCopyright \xc2\xa92021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
