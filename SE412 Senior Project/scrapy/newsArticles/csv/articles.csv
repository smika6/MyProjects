Tokyo (CNN) -- The morning after Japan was struck by the most powerful earthquake to hit the island nation in recorded history and the tsunami it unleashed -- and even as the earth continued to twitch with aftershocks -- the disaster's massive impact was only beginning to be revealed.

Rescue efforts began with the first light as military helicopters plucked survivors from roofs and carried them to safety.

The 8.9-magnitude temblor, which was centered near the east coast of Japan, killed hundreds of people, caused the formation of 30-foot walls of water that swept across rice fields, engulfed entire towns, dragged houses onto highways, and tossed cars and boats like toys. Some waves reached six miles (10 kilometers) inland in Miyagi Prefecture on Japan's east coast.

""The earth shook with such ferocity,"" said Andy Clark, who said he had gotten used to earthquakes during his 20 years in Japan but never experienced what he felt Friday at the airport outside Tokyo. ""I thought things were coming to an end ... it was simply terrifying.""

Buildings shook, heaved and collapsed by the score, and numerous fires ignited.

Hundreds more people were missing, Japanese media reported, citing local and national police. Tens of thousands of people were displaced, according to Japan's Kyodo News Agency.

Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the ""enormously powerful"" earthquake had caused ""tremendous damage over a wide area.""

The quake, which struck at 2:46 p.m. (12:46 a.m. ET), prompted the U.S. National Weather Service to issue tsunami warnings for at least 50 countries and territories.

The epicenter of Friday's main quake was located off Miyagi Prefecture, about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of Tokyo, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

Also in Miyagi, officials reported that a train had derailed and authorities had lost contact with four trains in coastal areas, Kyodo reported, citing the East Japan Railway Company.

Six million households, more than 10% of the total in Japan, were without electricity, said Japan's ambassador to the United States, Ichiro Fujisaki.

In Tokyo, rail service was suspended overnight, elevated highways were shut early Saturday and surface streets remained jammed as commuters -- thousands of whom had spent the night in shelters -- tried to get to their homes in outlying areas.

Video aired by Japanese broadcaster NHK showed extensive fires in Miyagi and in the port city of Hakodate, in the southern part of Hokkaido island in northern Japan. An oil refinery was burning in Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo, according to NHK. And Kyodo News said fires could be seen in extensive areas of Kesennuma in Miyagi.

Aerial views of Kesennuma showed plumes of white smoke emanating from the center of the city and large, black areas the flames had already traversed.

In the city of Minamisoma in Fukushima Prefecture, all that was left of many structures were their foundations. Only concrete and steel buildings appeared to have withstood the wash. No people were visible in the streets of the town, whose population on Friday had been 70,000.

And a dam in Fukushima Prefecture failed, washing away homes, Kyodo reported. There was no immediate word of casualties, but the Defense Ministry said 1,800 homes were destroyed.

The National Weather Service sent a warning to 50 countries and territories it said could be affected by the tsunami.

Scores of aftershocks jarred the country Saturday, punctuated by a pair of strong earthquakes in the early morning, including one with a magnitude of 7.1 and another with a magnitude of 6.8.

A leak occurred in an atomic power plant in northeast Japan, a spokesman for Japan's nuclear agency said Saturday. Cooling equipment stopped working when generators failed in the quake, and the temperature inside the plant in the Fukushima prefecture had risen; officials lowered the pressure inside the plant hangar by venting it, said spokesman Kazuo Kodama.

But high levels of radiation led officials to suspend the release, NHK said. Alternative plans were being evaluated, the broadcaster said.

Citing Japan's nuclear safety agency, Kyodo said radiation levels were 1,000 times above normal in the the control room of the facility's reactor.

An evacuation order was extended to people who live within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of the plant, named Fukushima Daiichi, about 160 miles (260 kilometers) north of Tokyo.

The agency said the radiation amount posed no immediate threat to the health of nearby residents, Kyodo reported.

Cooling problems also appeared to have affected to another of the Tokyo Electric Power Company's nuclear facilities.

Kyodo reported the power company alerted authorities that the cooling system at three units of another plant in the same prefecture. That prompted Japanese authorities to add that plant to its emergency list, along with the another plant, Kyodo said.

Prime Minister Kan inspected the plant and the rest of the affected region from a helicopter.

The government ordered the evacuation of residents nearest the plant as efforts to keep it cool after it was shut were initially hampered.

Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported Saturday that the death toll is more than 900, with about 700 others reported missing. Earlier Saturday the nation's Kyodo News News Agency, citing police, reported that the death toll was 433, with at least 784 missing.

The official death toll is likely to rise as authorities continue rescue and relief efforts in the worst-hit areas. Kyodo predicted the death toll would surpass 1,000.

The news agency, citing Japan's defense forces, also said 60,000 to 70,000 people were being evacuated to shelters in the Sendai area of Miyagi Prefecture.

The prime minister said an emergency task force had been activated, and he appealed for calm. The government dispatched 8,000 troops to assist in the recovery effort and asked for U.S. military assistance, according to Kyodo.

A spokesman for the U.S. military bases in Japan said all service members were accounted for and there were no reports of damage to installations or ships.

By early Saturday, more than 50 countries had offered help, said Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. U.S. President Barack Obama offered his condolences and said the United States was standing by to help ""in this time of great trial.""

The U.S. Navy initiated reconnaissance flights to map the disaster zone and was moving the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan into position to assist the Japanese government with relief efforts, defense officials said.

Images from Japanese media and CNN iReporters showed smoke pouring from buildings and water rushing across fields, carrying away entire structures.

""I wasn't scared when it started ... but it just kept going and going,"" said Michelle Roberts, who lives in central Tokyo. ""I won't lie, it was quite scary. But we are all OK. We live on the third floor, so most everything shook and shifted.""

The quake toppled cars off bridges and into waters underneath. Waves of debris flowed like lava across farmland, pushing boats, houses and trailers in their paths.

The quake also disrupted rail service and affected air travel. Hundreds of flights were canceled, Kyodo said. Some 13,000 people were stranded at the Narita airport, and 10,000 were stuck at the Haneda airport, the news agency said. Flights into and out of both airports had resumed Saturday.

At Tokyo Station, one of Japan's busiest subway terminals, shaken commuters grabbed one another to stay steady as the ground shook. Dazed residents poured into the streets, and offices and schools were closed. Children cried.

""This was larger than anyone expected and went on longer than anyone expected,"" said Matt Alt, who lives in Tokyo.

""My wife was the calm one. ... She told us to get down and put your back on something, and leave the windows and doors open in case a building shifts so you don't get trapped.""

The magnitude of the earthquake and its shallow depth -- 15.2 miles (24.5 kilometers) -- created a lot of energy, said Shenza Chen of the U.S. Geological Survey.

The impact was felt far and wide. In McKinleyville, California, a wave swept three men into the Pacific Ocean as they were reportedly trying to take photos of the incoming tsunami waves, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.

Two of the men returned to shore, but one died, officials said.

Japanese government officials said large tsunami waves were still a risk to coastal Japan, and they urged residents in coastal areas to move to higher ground.

The tsunami brought waves of nearly 7 feet to a harbor in Maui, authorities said, but other areas reported lower levels.

On the U.S. mainland, wave heights from Alaska to California ranged from less than a foot to more than 8 feet. The highest measurement, 8.1 feet, was at Crescent City, California.

Tsunamis are a series of long ocean waves that can last five to 15 minutes and cause extensive flooding in coastal areas. Sometimes, the waves hit in succession -- often the highest not being the first, CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said.

Humanitarian agencies were working with rescue crews to reach people affected by the earthquake and tsunami.

""When such an earthquake impacts a developed country like Japan, our concern also turns to countries like the Philippines and Indonesia, which might not have the same resources,"" said Rachel Wolff, a spokeswoman for World Vision.

Wolff said her agency is helping people in Japan and teaming up to help others in countries along the path of the tsunami.

The quake was the latest in a series around Japan this week.

On Wednesday, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Honshu, the country's meteorological agency said. Early Thursday, an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.3 struck off the same coast.

Friday's quake is the strongest earthquake in recorded history to hit Japan, according to U.S. Geologic Survey records. The previous record was an 8.6-magnitude earthquake that struck near the Chubu Region near southwestern Honshu on October 28, 1707, that may have killed 5,000 people, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said.

That quake generated a 33-foot (10-meter) tsunami wave, and some scientists believe the quake may have triggered the eruption of Mount Fuji 49 days later, Morris said.

The world's largest recorded quake took place in Chile on May 22, 1960, with a magnitude of 9.5, the USGS said.

NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- New Orleans braced for a catastrophic blow from Hurricane Katrina overnight, as forecasters predicted the Category 5 storm could drive a wall of water over the city's levees.

The huge storm, packing 160 mph winds, is expected to hit the northern Gulf Coast in the next nine hours and make landfall as a Category 4 or 5 hurricane Monday morning.

The National Hurricane Center reports that conditions are already deteriorating along the central and northeastern coast. (Watch video to see the worst case scenario)

New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin declared a state of emergency Sunday and ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city. (Watch video of mayor's announcement)

""This is a threat that we've never faced before,"" Nagin said. ""If we galvanize and gather around each other, I'm sure we will get through this.""

He exempted essential federal, state, and local personnel; emergency and utility workers; transit workers; media; hotel workers; and patrons from the evacuation order.

About 1.3 million people live in New Orleans and its suburbs, and many began evacuating before sunrise. (Watch video to see who's staying and who's leaving)

Nagin estimated that nearly 1 million people had fled the city and its surrounding parishes by Sunday night. (Watch time lapse video of the evacuation)

Between 20,000 and 25,000 others who remained in the city lined up to take shelter in the Louisiana Superdome, lining up for what authorities warned would be an unpleasant day and a half at minimum.

City officials told stranded tourists to stay on third-floor levels or higher and away from windows. (See video from New Orleans, a city below sea level)

Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco said that New Orleans could expect a complete loss of electricity and water services as well as intense flooding.

""We know we're going to have property damage,"" she told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""We know we're going to have high wind damage. We're hoping we're not going to lose a lot of lives.""

About 70 percent of New Orleans is below sea level, and is protected from the Mississippi River by a series of levees. (Full story)

Forecasters predicted the storm surge could reach 28 feet; the highest levees around New Orleans are 18 feet high.

Hurricane-force winds extend 105 miles from the center of the mammoth storm and tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles. It is the most powerful storm to menace the central Gulf Coast in decades.

Isolated tornadoes are also possible Sunday across southern portions of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, forecasters said.

Federal Emergency Management Agency teams and other emergency teams were in place to move in as soon as the storm was over, FEMA Undersecretary Michael Brown said.

Katrina is blamed for at least seven deaths in Florida, where it made landfall Thursday as a Category 1 hurricane. As much as 18 inches of rain fell in some areas, flooding streets and homes. (See video of the damage floodwaters left in one family's new house)

At midnight ET, Katrina was centered about 90 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River. It was moving to the northwest at about 10 mph.

National Hurricane Center Director Max Mayfield said: ""There's certainly a chance it can weaken a bit before it gets to the coast, but unfortunately this is so large and so powerful that it's a little bit like the difference between being run over by an 18-wheeler or a freight train. Neither prospect is good."" (Watch Mayfield's assessment of Katrina)

Bush issues disaster declarations

President Bush announced Sunday that he had issued disaster declarations for Louisiana, Mississippi and parts of southern Florida. The declaration for Miami-Dade and Broward counties in Florida will allow residents there to apply for federal disaster aid.

""We'll do everything in our power to help the people and communities affected by this storm,"" he said.

The president urged anyone in the storm's path ""to put their own safety and the safety of their families first by moving to safe ground.""

Jesse St. Amant, the emergency management chief for Louisiana's southernmost Plaquemines Parish, said nearly 95 percent of the parish's 27,000-plus residents had fled by Sunday afternoon. Those who remained were being told that they are ""gambling with their own lives.""

""I think they just don't believe something of this nature can ever happen in their lifespan, and I think they're going to be wrong,"" he said.

As far east as Mobile, Alabama, 118 miles away from New Orleans, authorities warned of storm surges approaching 20 feet.

""I'm afraid most people look at the map and say, 'It's going to New Orleans, we're all right,'"" said Mobile Mayor Mike Deal. ""We're in harm's way with the current path of this storm.""

Hurricane warnings are posted from Morgan City, Louisiana, eastward to the Alabama-Florida state line, including New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain. This means winds of at least 74 mph are expected in the warning area within the next 24 hours.

A tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch are in effect from the Alabama-Florida state line eastward to Destin, Florida, and from west of Morgan City to Intracoastal City, Louisiana. A tropical storm warning is also in effect from Intracoastal City, Louisiana, west to Cameron, Louisiana, and from Destin, Florida, eastward to Indian Pass, Florida.

A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions, including winds of at least 39 mph, are expected within 24 hours. A hurricane watch means hurricane conditions are possible, usually within 36 hours.

Category 5 is the most intense on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Only three Category 5 hurricanes have made landfall in the United States since records were kept. Those were the Labor Day hurricane of 1935, 1969's Hurricane Camille and Hurricane Andrew, which devastated the Miami area in 1992. Andrew remains the costliest U.S. hurricane on record, with $26.5 billion in losses.

Camille came ashore in Mississippi and killed 256 people.",https://www.cnn.com/2005/WEATHER/08/28/hurricane.katrina/
CNN,House Speaker,Pelosi: 'Let us work together',"Story Highlights • Pelosi accepts gavel as first female House speaker

• Tribute paid to Gerald Ford, her family

• Speaker sets out goals for first 100 hours

• Among priorities is new plan for Iraq, military



Adjust font size:

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- This is a transcript of the speech Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, gave Thursday after being elected speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives:

Thank you, Leader Boehner, Mr. Speaker.

I accept this gavel in the spirit of partnership, not partisanship, and I look forward to working with you, Mr. Boehner, and the Republicans in the Congress for the good of the American people.

After giving this gavel away in the first two -- in the last two Congresses, I'm glad someone else has the honor today.

In this House we may be different parties but we serve one country. And our pride and our prayers are united behind our men and women in uniform.

They are working together to protect the American people. And in this Congress we must work together to build a future worthy of their sacrifice.

Tribute to Ford

In this hour we need and pray for the character, courage and civility of a former member of this House: President Ford. He healed the country when it needed healing. This is another time, another war and another trial of our American will, imagination and spirit.

Let us honor his memory not just in eulogy but in dialogue and trust across the aisle.

I want to join Leader Boehner in expressing our condolences and our appreciation to Mrs. Ford and to the entire Ford family for their decades of leadership and service to our country.

With today's convening of the 110th Congress we begin anew. I congratulate all members of Congress on your election. I especially want to congratulate our new members of Congress.

The genius of our founders was that -- let's hear it for our new members of ...

The genius of our founders was that every two years new members would bring to this House their spirit of renewal and hope for the American people. This Congress is reinvigorated, new members, by your optimism and your idealism, and your commitment to our country.

Nod to family

Let us acknowledge your families, whose support have made your leadership possible today -- to your families.

Each of us brings to this Congress our shared values, our commitment to the Constitution, and our personal experience.

My path to Congress and to the speakership began in Baltimore, where my father was the mayor. I was raised in a large family that was devoutly Catholic, deeply patriotic, very proud of our Italian-American heritage and staunchly Democratic.

My parents taught us that public service was a noble calling and that we had a responsibility to help those in need. I viewed them as working on the side of the angels, and now they are with them.

But I am so happy that my brother Tommy D'Alesandro, who was also a mayor of Baltimore, is here leading the D'Alesandro family from Baltimore today.

He's sitting right up there with Tony Bennett.

Forty-three years ago Paul Pelosi and I were married. We raised our five children in San Francisco, where Paul was born and raised. I want to thank Paul and our five children -- Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul Jr. and Alexandra -- and our magnificent grandchildren -- for their love, for their support and the confidence they gave me to go from the kitchen to the Congress.

And I thank my constituents in San Francisco and for the state of California for the privilege of representing them in Congress.

Saint Francis of Assisi is our city's patron saint. And his ""Song of Saint Francis"" is our city's anthem: ""Lord, make me a channel of thy peace; where there is darkness may we bring light, where there is hatred may we bring love, where is despair may we bring hope.""

Hope: That is what America is about. And it is in that spirit that I serve in the Congress of the United States.

First female speaker

And today I thank my colleagues. By electing me speaker you have brought us closer to the ideal of equality that is America's heritage and America's hope.

This is an historic moment, and I thank the leader for acknowledging it. Thank you, Mr. Boehner.

It's an historic moment for the Congress. It's an historic moment for the women of America.

It is a moment for which we have waited over 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights.

But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal.

For our daughters and our granddaughters today we have broken the marble ceiling.

For our daughters and our granddaughters now the sky is the limit. Anything is possible for them.

The election of 2006 was a call to change, not merely to change the control of Congress but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in the war in Iraq.

The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.

Shortly, President Bush will address the nation on the subject of Iraq. It is the responsibility of the president to articulate a new plan for Iraq that makes it clear to the Iraqis that they must defend their own streets and their own security, a plan that promotes stability in the region and a plan that allows us to responsibly redeploy our troops.

Let us work together to be the Congress that rebuilds our military to meet the national security challenges of the 21st century.

Let us be the Congress that strongly honors our responsibility to protect the American people from terrorism.

Let us be the Congress that never forgets our commitment to our veterans and our first responders, always honoring them as the heroes that they are.

'A new America'

The American people also spoke clearly for a new direction here at home. They desire a new vision, a new America built on the values that have made our country great.

Our founders envisioned a new America driven by optimism, opportunity and strength. So confident were they in the America that they were advancing that they put on the seal, the great seal of the United States, ""novus ordo seclorum"" -- a new order for the centuries -- centuries. They spoke of the centuries -- that they envisioned America as a just and good place, as a fair and efficient society, and as a source of opportunity for all.

This vision has sustained us for over 200 years, and it accounts for what is best in our great nation: liberty, opportunity and justice.

Now it is our responsibility to carry forth that vision of a new America into the 21st century.

A new America that seizes the future and forges 21st-century solutions through discovery, creativity and innovation, sustaining our economic leadership and ensuring our national security.

A new America with a vibrant and strengthened middle class for whom college is affordable, health care is accessible and retirement reliable.

A new America that declares our energy independence, promotes domestic sources of renewable energy and combats climate change. A new America that is strong, secure and a respected leader among the community of nations. And the American people told us they expected us to work together for fiscal responsibility, with the highest ethical standard and with civility and bipartisanship.

After years of historic deficits this 110th Congress will commit itself to a higher standard: Pay as you go; no new deficit spending.

Our new America will provide unlimited opportunity for future generations, not burden them with mountains of debt.

In order to achieve our new America for the 21st century we must return this House to the American people. So our first order of business is passing the toughest congressional ethics reform in history.

This new Congress doesn't have two years or 200 days. Let us join together in the first 100 hours to make this Congress the most honest and open Congress in history.

One hundred hours.

This openness requires respect for every voice in the Congress. As Thomas Jefferson said, every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle.

My colleagues elected me to be speaker of the House, the entire House. Respectful of division of our founders, the expectations of our people and the great challenges that we face, we have an obligation to reach beyond partisanship to work for all America.

Let us stand together to move our country forward, seeking common ground for the common good.

We have made history. Now, let us make progress for the American people.

May God bless our work, and may God bless America.

CNN,Hussein Executed,Hussein executed with 'fear in his face',"Story Highlights • NEW: Iraqi TV airs video of noose placed around Hussein's neck

• Hussein refused to wear black hood

• Bush praises Iraqis for giving fair trial

• Celebrations break out in Baghdad and Michigan



Adjust font size:

BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Saddam Hussein, the former Iraqi dictator who spent his last years in captivity after his ruthless regime was toppled by the U.S.-led coalition in 2003, was hanged before dawn Saturday for crimes committed in a brutal crackdown during his reign.

The execution took place shortly after 6 a.m. (10 p.m. Friday ET), Iraq's national security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, told Iraqi television.

""This dark page has been turned over,"" Rubaie said. ""Saddam is gone. Today Iraq is an Iraq for all the Iraqis, and all the Iraqis are looking forward. ... The [Hussein] era has gone forever."" (Watch noose placed around Hussein's neck )

Al-Iraqiya state television aired videotape of Hussein's last moments several hours after the execution.

The video showed Hussein, dressed in a black overcoat, being led into a room by three masked guards.

The broadcast only showed the execution to the point where the noose was placed over Hussein's head and tightened around his neck. No audio was heard.

Rubaie, who witnessed the execution, said the former leader was ""strangely submissive"" to the process.

""He was a broken man,"" he said. ""He was afraid. You could see fear in his face.""

Rubaie said that Hussein carried with him a copy of the Quran and asked that it be given to ""a certain person."" Rubaie did not identify that person.

On Al-Arabiya television, Rubaie said the execution took place at the 5th Division intelligence office in Qadhimiya. He said Hussein refused to wear a black hood over his head before execution and told him ""don't be afraid."" (Watch Rubaie describe Hussein's final moments )

White House deputy press secretary Scott Stanzel said President Bush was asleep when the execution took place and was not awakened. The president had been briefed by national security adviser Stephen Hadley before retiring and was aware the hanging was imminent, Stanzel said.

The White House issued a statement praising the Iraqi people for giving Hussein a fair trial.

""Fair trials were unimaginable under Saddam Hussein's tyrannical rule,"" Bush's statement read. ""It is a testament to the Iraqi people's resolve to move forward after decades of oppression that, despite his terrible crimes against his own people, Saddam Hussein received a fair trial."" (Full story)

The execution took place outside the heavily fortified Green Zone, Rubaie said, and no Americans were present.

""It was an Iraqi operation from A to Z,"" he said. ""The Americans were not present during the hour of the execution. They weren't even in the building.""

He added that ""there were no Shiite or Sunni clerics present, only the witnesses and those who carried out the actual execution were present.""

Hussein was hanged for his role in the 1982 Dujail massacre, in which 148 Iraqis were killed after a failed assassination attempt against the then-Iraqi president. (Watch what happened in Dujail )

Two other co-defendants -- Barzan Hassan, Hussein's half-brother, and Awwad Bandar, the former chief judge of the Revolutionary Court -- were also found guilty and had been expected to face execution with Hussein, but Rubaie said their executions were postponed.

""We chose to postpone Barzan and Awwad's execution to a later date because we wanted to have this day to have an historic distinction,"" he said. ""We wanted to have one specific date for Saddam so people remember this date to be linked to Saddam's execution and nothing else.""

Rubaie said the execution was videotaped and photographed extensively from the time Hussein was transferred from U.S. to Iraqi custody until he was dead.

Many of those who witnessed the execution celebrated in the aftermath. (Full story)

""Saddam's body is in front me,"" said an official in the prime minister's office when CNN telephoned. ""It's over.""

In the background, Shiite chanting could be heard. When asked about the chanting, the official said, ""These are employees of the prime minister's office and government chanting in celebration."" (Watch what Hussein's death could mean in Iraq )

He said that celebrations broke out after Hussein was dead, and that there was ""dancing around the body.""

Iraqi-Americans celebrated in the street in Dearborn, Michigan, home to the largest concentration of Iraqis in the United States. (Watch Iraqi-Americans dancing, kissing and singing in the streets )

Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki did not attend the execution, according to an adviser to the prime minister who was interviewed on state television.

""It's a very solemn moment for me,"" Feisal Istrabadi, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, said on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""I can understand why some of my compatriots may be cheering. I have friends whose particular people I can think of who have lost 10, 15, 20 members of their family, more.

""But for me, it's a moment really of remembrance of the victims of Saddam Hussein.""

Friday evening, a U.S. district judge refused a request to stay the execution.

Attorney Nicholas Gilman said in an application for a restraining order, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Washington, that a stay would allow Hussein ""to be informed of his rights and take whatever action he can and may wish to pursue.""

Munir Haddad, a judge on the appeals court that upheld the former dictator's death sentence, called Gilman's filing ""rubbish,"" and said, ""It will not delay carrying out the sentence,"" which he called ""final.""

Throughout the day, there were conflicting reports about who had custody of Hussein. Giovanni di Stefano, one of Hussein's defense attorneys, told CNN the U.S. military officially informed him that the former Iraqi dictator had been transferred to Iraqi custody, but that the move in U.S. court could have meant that Hussein was back in U.S. custody.

There had been speculation that Hussein would be executed before Eid Al-Adha -- a holiday period that means Feast of the Sacrifice, celebrated by Muslims around the world at the climax of the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The law does not permit executions to be carried out during religious holidays.

Eid began Saturday for Sunnis and begins Sunday for Shiites. It lasts for four days. Hussein was a Sunni Muslim.

Meeting with half-brothers

Another defense lawyer, Badie Aref, told CNN that Hussein met with two of his half-brothers in his cell on Thursday and passed on messages and instructions to his family.

""President Saddam was just bracing for the worst, so he wanted to see his brothers and pass on some messages and instructions to his family,"" Aref said. The half brothers who visited were Sabawi and Wathban Ibrahim Hassan al-Tikriti, he said.

He never asked to see anyone else -- not even his wife, said his lawyers. She was the mother of his five children.

Aref said the U.S. soldiers guarding Hussein on Tuesday took away a radio he kept in his cell so he could not hear news reports about his death sentence, which was confirmed that day.

""They did not want him to hear the news from the appeals court upholding the sentence,"" he said. ""They gave him back the radio on Wednesday.""

Aref said Saddam found out about the appeals court verdict ""a few hours after it was announced.""

Crimes against humanity

Hussein was convicted on November 5 of crimes against humanity in connection with the killings of 148 people in the town of Dujail after an attempt on his life.

The dictator was found guilty of murder, torture and forced deportation.

The Dujail episode falls within 12 of the worst cases out of 500 documented ""baskets of crimes"" during the Hussein regime.

The U.S. State Department says torture and extrajudicial killings followed the Dujail killings and that 550 men, women and children were arrested without warrants.

Trust the British to get it right – in the end. When it comes to taking stock on London 2012, I believe the London Games will be regarded as having brought the Olympics concept home.

Britain has brought the Olympics back to what they have been and should always be. And we did it with that unique common sense for which my country is known.

To be sure, the London Games were not as spectacular as, say Beijing. Nor did they have the exotic “new world” quality of Sydney so wonderfully laced with Australian freshness. They haven’t been the biggest, the brightest, the tallest, the largest, the (you add your own superlative here).

Instead, they have been what they were always meant to be – a celebration of athletic prowess infused with a tremendous sense of fun and good spirit emanating from the host nation’s culture.

CNN's Richard Quest

Everything that has been bad about games in recent years was slowly, carefully addressed and ultimately dealt with in London.

The opening ceremony set the tone. With its green fields and satanic mills, to the self-deprecating humor from the Monarch herself, London sent the not-so-subtle message: This wasn’t going to be “Olympics as usual.”

The Games’ big budgets

Montreal finally finished off paying for the 1976 games 30 years later in November 2006. Athens was twice over budget. And of course, we will never know how much the Beijing games truly cost.

In London an original, fictional bid-budget of £2.7 billion ($4.2 billion) was quickly abandoned in 2007 in favor of a realistic, £9.3 billion ($14.6 billion) with a huge contingency for unforeseen costs such as security.

To those who criticize the three-times bid-budget, there is one crucial fact to bear in mind.

In 2008, like other countries in recession, Britain embarked on stimulus spending. We were fortunate that we actually had real projects and purpose upon which to spend the cash, rather than the bridges and roads to nowhere of other countries. We didn’t have to invent places to spend the money because the Olympics was waiting. If there was ever a time to have the Olympics, this was it – when the expenditure was economically needed.

In fact, the contingency money allocated has proved to be more than enough. A political row is about to break out over what to do with the £300 million under-spend and whether it should just be handed back to the cash-strapped UK Treasury. My own view is some of it should be used for a tourism campaign next year to help bring those guests who stayed away fearing the crowds.

The Olympic legacy

Olympics today are all about legacy. It was the prospect of regenerating London’s derelict East End which helped win the games. Since then billions of pounds have been spent, not just on the facilities per se, but on the infrastructure around them. And in the city, those of us who live here and have suffered years of weekend closure of tube lines for “scheduled maintenance” and “replacing signals” can be in no doubt we will reap the benefits once everyone has gone home. We have a regenerated subway that is once again world-class.

So when the IOC President Jacques Rogge said, “London has created a legacy blueprint” and “has raised the bar on how to deliver a lasting legacy,” we can neatly tick that one off as a rousing success from which other cities can learn.

Organizational triumph

From day one, Britain was determined not to have another Wembley fiasco, or Millennium Dome disaster, where it seemed every major construction project ended up delayed, over budget and in acrimony (incidentally the Dome is now the most successful concert venue in Europe as the O2 arena – so there!)

With the Olympics, we simply got on with it. The Aquatics Centre, designed by Zaha Hadid, was completed and tested a year before the games began. The Olympic Stadium had the lights switched on by the Prime Minister back in December and its final test was four months before the opening ceremony.

In fact the IOC never did doubt everything would be ready.

London has conclusively shown that by being more realistic in ambition, everything can be done without the heartache and angst of previous games.

For the British people themselves, there has been a renewed pride in the country – helped of course by record gold medals. I accept this might be a mile wide but an inch deep, but I cannot recall the last time I have seen so many people proudly walking the streets with the Union Jack flag wrapped around their shoulders. The legacy of confidence means it is the challenge of politicians and civic leaders to foster that spirit so it doesn’t disappear along with the fleeting summer sun.

Every time London has hosted the games it has done so in testing times. In 1908 London rescued the Olympics after Mount Vesuvius volcano erupted, causing the selected city of Rome to pull out. In 1948 London hosted the so-called “Austerity Games” three years after the end of WWII. They were the first Olympics in 12 years.

So re-establishing the Olympics is something of a tradition here. To this we now add 2012, where I gently suggest London has subtly re-established the Olympic tradition by bringing back a dose of sanity. We have proved, firstly, that the Olympics are manageable, and affordable, if done right. We have proved they can be fun for everyone (even the people who live in the city).

London will probably never host the games again. I was proud to be in the stadium on Saturday night singing our national anthem after Mo Farah won his second gold medal. Just as I have been proud to be here, in my capital city, to see us get it right and leave a legacy for the city, the country and the games themselves.",https://www.cnn.com/2012/08/12/sport/london-olympics-close-quest/index.html

CNN —

Two bombs struck near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday, turning a celebration into a bloody scene of destruction.

Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said Monday night that the death toll had risen to three. Scores were injured at the scene.

One of the dead was an 8-year-old boy, according to a state law enforcement source.

Hospitals reported at least 144 people are being treated, with at least 17 of them in critical condition and 25 in serious condition. At least eight of the patients are children.

At least 10 people injured had limbs amputated, according to a terrorism expert briefed on the investigation.

Several of the patients treated at Massachusetts General Hospital suffered injuries to lower limbs that will require “serial operations” in the coming days, trauma surgeon Peter Fagenholz said Monday night. Some injuries were so severe amputations were necessary, Fagenholz added.

Full horror of the day emerges in emergency rooms

In Washington, President Barack Obama vowed, “Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups, will feel the full weight of justice.”

Boston “is a tough and resilient town,” he said, adding that Americans will stand by Bostonians “every single step of the way.”

’Like a huge cannon’

The terrorist attack, near the marathon’s finish line, triggered widespread screaming and chaos, shattered windows and barricades and sent smoke billowing into the air at Copley Square.

The blasts were about 50 to 100 yards apart, officials said, on a stretch of the marathon course lined with spectators cheering runners through the final yards of a 26-mile, 385-yard endurance feat.

“It felt like a huge cannon,” a witness told CNN about one of the blasts.

Allan Panter, a doctor who was near the finish line waiting for his wife to finish the race, told CNN he was standing about 20 to 25 feet from the first blast. He said he treated victims on the street after the explosion.

“I saw at least six to seven people down next to me,” he said. “They protected me from the blast. One lady expired. One gentleman lost both his (lower) limbs. Most of the injuries were lower extremities.”

Flights banned over Boston Marathon blast site

Bill Iffrig, 78 and a veteran marathoner, was nearing the finish when “the shock waves just hit my whole body and my legs just started jittering around.” Iffrig, who can be seen in video of the explosion wearing an orange tank top, was helped to his feet by an event volunteer and had just a scratch from his fall, he told CNN.

Federal authorities are classifying the bombings as a terrorist attack, but it’s not clear whether the origin was domestic or foreign, a federal law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation said.

A federal law enforcement official told CNN that both bombs were small, and initial tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive material, suggesting that the packages used in the attack were crude explosive devices.

Another explosive device found

Authorities in Boston found at least one other explosive device that they were dismantling, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said.

Rep. Bill Keating of Massachusetts, meanwhile, said two more were found.

One unexploded device was found at a hotel on Boylston Street near the bomb site and another unexploded device was found at an undisclosed location, Keating, a Democrat and member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said. He called the bombing a “sophisticated, coordinated, planned attack.”

FBI to take lead in investigation, seeks bomb ‘signature’

It was unclear who may have planted the marathon bombs. There were no credible threats before the race, a state government official said.

There is no suspect in custody, but many people are being questioned, Davis said.

Investigators warned police to be on the lookout for a “darker-skinned or black male” with a possible foreign accent in connection with the attack, according to a law enforcement advisory obtained by CNN. The man was seen with a black backpack and sweatshirt and was trying to get into a restricted area about five minutes before the first explosion, the lookout notice states.

Also, a Saudi national with a leg wound was under guard at a Boston hospital in connection with the bombings, but investigators cannot say he is involved at this time and he is not in custody, a law enforcement official said Monday evening.

In addition to scrutinizing images of surveillance cameras in the area, the FBI likely was issuing subpoenas for records from cell towers in the area to isolate and trace calls from around Copley Square at the time of the blasts, according to a former federal law enforcement official who now works in the intelligence community.

The unexploded devices that were recovered could provide a treasure trove of information such as fingerprints and indications of the bomb maker’s design, and from the bombs that did explode, investigators would be looking for fragments and anything indicating the “signature” of the bomb makers, the official told CNN.

As authorities searched the scene, numerous suspicious packages were found, possibly because people fled the area, leaving items behind. Investigators were checking them.

All off-duty Boston police were called in.

The Marriott hotel at Copley Place was evacuated as a precaution.

The Lenox Hotel was also evacuated as a precaution, the Boston Globe reported.

’Horrific day’

Crowds were in the area watching the runners take part in the world’s oldest annual marathon.

It was also Patriots Day, commemorating the opening battle of the Revolutionary War.

Within seconds, the festive occasion turned into devastation.

“This is a horrific day in Boston,” Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said in a statement.

“My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been injured. I have been in touch with the president, Mayor (Thomas) Menino and our public safety leaders. Our focus is on making sure that the area around Copley Square is safe and secured. I am asking everyone to stay away from Copley Square and let the first responders do their jobs.”

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke with FBI Director Robert Mueller and U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, a Justice Department official said.

Holder has directed the full resources of the Justice Department to be deployed to ensure the matter is fully investigated, the official said.

The Federal Aviation Administration placed a flight restriction over the site of the blasts.

Other cities, including New York and Washington, tightened security as a result. Following standard protocol, the White House cleared out an area in front of the West Wing.

Mike Baingon, who works at the Atlantic Fish Company in Boston, said an explosion took place in front of the restaurant and that he was right by the front door at the time.

The explosions occurred at about 2:45 p.m., more than two hours after the first of the race’s nearly 27,000 runners had crossed the finish line, CNN Producer Matt Frucci reported.

The race was halted as was subway service into the area.

Troops from the Massachusetts National Guard, already at the site as part of the marathon’s security and crowd-management plan, were assisting police as well.

CNN,BP Oil Spill,"As oil spill nears Gulf Coast, experts issue dire warnings","Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- Gulf coast residents braced Saturday for the arrival of a massive oil slick creeping toward shore as nearly a million feet of boom were deployed in an effort to protect precious estuaries and wildlife -- even as thousands of barrels of crude continued gushing into the water.

Landfall along the Mississippi River Delta and other Gulf areas was expected as early as Saturday.

""I'm pretty much on pause right now ... it's just a big waiting game,"" said David Boola, a fisherman who leads boat trips for tourists out of Venice, Louisiana.

But even as officials and residents wait for the oil to reach land, the slick has already taken a dramatic toll on life all along the Gulf Coast, bringing fishing and tourism to a halt in many places and threatening to cripple those industries for weeks to come.

""I'm extremely worried because I have customers that [have] already canceled trips,"" Boola told CNN Saturday. ""I should be out taking people fishing today and I'm not. I'm not making money today. Or tomorrow. I'm worried about the now factor, you know?""

Government leaders echoed those fears.

""The oil that is leaking offshore, the oil that is coming onto our coast threatens more than just our wildlife, our fisheries, our coast,"" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said at a Saturday press conference. ""This oil literally threatens our way of life.""

The oil company BP -- which operated the rig whose sinking caused the underwater oil gusher -- partnered with government officials to hold town hall meetings throughout the region Saturday to respond to concern about the spill's consequences.

But frustration was growing Saturday in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. At a town hall meeting in Bayou La Batre, Alabama, Mayor Stan Wright warned fishermen in the audience that outbursts would be met with arrest. The fishermen were told that they were not allowed to ask questions.

Jindal suggested the response to the oil slick has so far been inadequate, saying ""we continue to be concerned with BP's ability to respond to this incident.""

Jindal said he has been working with local officials to develop cleanup contingency plans, but needs funding approval from BP and authorization from the U.S. Coast Guard's incident commander to move forward.

""We need to empower our locals on the ground,"" he said.

""Now they're saying we are seeing sheens,"" hitting the coast, Jindal said Saturday, citing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""But they expect the heavier oil to be coming by tomorrow and Monday.""

U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Thad Allen -- who the Obama administration designated Saturday to lead response to the oil slick -- said that oil is likely to reach shorelines in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.

""The real question is when,"" he said.

Allen said Saturday that the government and BP's top priority is trying to stop the oil leak, but offered no timetable for when that goal might be achieved.

""We don't know how many days the discharge will continue to occur,"" he said.

Such reports darkened forecasts about the spill's environmental impact.

""This has the potential of being truly devastating,"" Tom McKenzie, of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told CNN.

Environmentalist Richard Charter of the Defenders of Wildlife organization said the magnitude of the oil leak could cause damage that would last decades.

""This event is a self-feeding fire,"" Charter told CNN. ""It is so big and expanding so fast that it's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective. ... You're looking at a long-term poisoning of the area. Ultimately, this will have a multi-decade impact.""

President Obama announced he will visit the oil spill area Sunday morning.

The oil spill started April 20, after an explosion on the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven oil rig workers remain missing and are presumed dead.

The rig sank April 22 about 50 miles (80 km) off the southeast coast of Louisiana, and the untapped wellhead is gushing about 5,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico, according to BP and government estimates. Some environmentalists say the amount could be much larger.

About 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion, the Coast Guard said.

BP said two Louisiana communities -- Venice and Port Fourchon -- will be the first places likely hit by the oil slick.

Nearly 2,000 personnel have joined the response effort, which includes 68 vessels, among them skimmers, tugs, barges and oil-recovery ships, officials said.

Crews worked through Friday night to dispense 3,000 gallons of sub-surface dispersant, officials said. The Coast Guard's Allen said that an initial test of dispersant released near the wellhead suggested the method could ""significantly mitigate the amount [of oil] that makes it to the surface.""

Such tests have never been done before, BP spokeswoman Marti Powers said. She said that the dispersants attach themselves to underwater concentrations of oil, causing the oil to sink to the bottom and dissipate.

While the dispersants can help dissipate oil slicks and help birds and other land-based or water-surface wildlife, the chemicals can hurt fish and other underwater species, environmentalist Charter said.

""The scale of the event and the likely duration of the event ... really leaves responders with no good options,"" Charter said. ""While [dispersants] can protect terrestial wildlife ... out in the ocean they make toxic biocomponents available to the marine food chain.""

Rapid response teams are staged to deploy to shorelines affected by the oil, federal officials said Saturday. The teams will evaluate and determine an appropriate clean-up effort to minimize impact on the environment.

In addition, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has approved Jindal's request to mobilize 6,000 National Guard troops.

Meanwhile, the Minerals Management Service has been in contact with all oil and gas operators in the oil spill area, officials said. Two platforms have stopped production and one has been evacuated as a safety measure, federal officials said in a release Saturday morning.

Federal officials have urged BP to beef up its response.

""We'll continue to urge BP to leverage additional assets,"" Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said Friday as she toured the area. ""It is time for BP to supplement their current mobilization as the slick of oil moves toward shore.""

Doug Suttles, chief operating officer of BP, said the company has had three priorities: stop the flow of oil, minimize its impact and keep the public informed.

""We've so far mounted the largest response effort ever done in the world,"" Suttles said. ""We've utilized every technology available, we've applied every resource request. ... We welcome every new idea and every offer of support.""

BP said it has been trying to stop the flow by using remote-controlled submarines to activate a valve atop the well. But the valve is not working, the energy company said.

As concerns about the spill's toll mount -- particularly in the commercial fishing industry, a critical $2.4 billion economic engine for the region -- Obama promised steps to prevent a similar disaster in the future.

The president asked Interior Secretary Ken Salazar ""to conduct a thorough review of this incident and report back to me in 30 days on what, if any, additional precautions and technologies should be required to prevent accidents like this from happening again.""

Federal officials, including the president, emphasized that BP is legally responsible for paying the costs of the response to and cleanup of the spill.

The cause of the blast on the Deepwater Horizon remains unknown.

Seventeen of the 126 people on the rig were injured in the blast, three of them critically. One person remained hospitalized Saturday, federal officials said.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee is investigating.

CNN,Swine Flu,"H1N1 death toll estimated at 3,900 in U.S.","Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Nearly 3,900 people, including about 540 children, are believed to have died from the H1N1 flu in the first six months of the epidemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.

The figure is a sharp increase from previous counts of laboratory-confirmed cases. But Dr. Anne Schuchat, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the estimate gives a ""more accurate picture"" of the scale of the pandemic.

The figure was based on a detailed analysis of data from several dozen districts around the country, she said. The method used to calculate the mortality figures is similar to that used to produce estimates of ordinary seasonal flu deaths, which are believed to number about 36,000 a year.

An estimated 22 million people in the United States have contracted the virus, commonly known as swine flu, resulting in about 98,000 hospitalizations through October 17, Schuchat said.

Among children under 18, about 8 million are believed to have been sickened, 36,000 have been hospitalized and 540 have died, a much higher number than the 129 laboratory-confirmed child deaths the CDC reported November 6.

About 12 million adults up to age 64 had been reported ill, with 53,000 hospitalizations in that age group and 2,900 deaths. People over age 65 accounted for 2 million illnesses, 9,000 hospitalizations and 440 deaths, Schuchat said.

The prevalence of flu cases is higher than at any time since the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, she said, but the death rate is ""nowhere near the severity of the 1918 pandemic.""

Schuchat said 41.6 million doses of H1N1 vaccine are now available, up from 38 million last week, but ""not as much as we'd hoped to have by today."" She told reporters last week that about 8 million new doses were expected this week.

The Department of Health and Human Services has ordered 75 million doses of swine flu vaccine for delivery by year's end, and the CDC had predicted that 40 million doses would be available by the end of October.

Production delays have hampered agency plans, and the lag has led to criticism of the program. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday found Americans are starting to lose confidence in the government's ability to prevent a nationwide epidemic, though a narrow majority continue to say that the government and private industry will eventually produce enough of the vaccine to inoculate everyone who wants it.",http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/11/12/h1n1.flu.deaths/index.html

CNN,Area 51 Raid,There were (thankfully) fewer alien enthusiasts than authorities expected. There were arrests and a Naruto runner,"Rachel, Nevada (CNN) — The day we had all been waiting for is finally here -- but it wasn't as exciting as expected. And that's probably for the best.

Two million people had pledged to storm Area 51 , the highly classified US Air Force facility in Nevada, on Friday to ""see them aliens.""

Instead, many of the 3,000 or so people that showed up in surrounding areas decided against storming the mystifying location, the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office said.

""They did threaten that they were going to storm,"" Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee said. ""Once officers warned them about the consequences for storming the base, they did have second thoughts.""

There was one alcohol-related arrest and a Canadian citizen was also arrested for indecent exposure, Lee said. One woman came close to crossing and she was briefly detained and released at the scene.

The sheriff said the Nevada Highway Patrol had also made a couple of arrests.

'Come, look, see'

The crowd was ""very manageable for emergency services,"" Lee said, adding it was nowhere near the number of people initially expected.

""The crowd has been good,"" he said. ""Officers have been mingling with the crowds and the crowds have been positive and so far it's been really well.""

But they expect more people to show up throughout the day and night, the sheriff said, and are keeping their guard up.

Lee's advice: ""Come, look, see what you can see, but just don't cross.""

Many of the campers told CNN they had no plans to go through with the raid Friday.

Mary Ramirez, sporting an alien-themed T-shirt and alien sunglasses, said she thought storming Area 51 would be a bad idea.

""You think I'm crazy?,"" she said.

One Arizona resident said he came out for the fun of it.

""Just like this thing said, everybody's always wondered, are they really holding aliens down there,"" the camper said.

The Facebook event's creator had already disavowed the whole thing and the page was taken down. But that didn't stop alien enthusiasts from dedicating the day to our fellow galaxy residents. There were multiple events planned around the base and many attendees camped out in nearby highways, enjoying a sunny day and a drink.

So, how did all the hullabaloo get started?

The creator underestimated the allure

Matty Roberts was just joking. He didn't believe anyone would take him seriously when, on June 27, he created a Facebook page for an event entitled ""Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us.""

But Roberts may have underestimated the allure of Area 51, the highly classified US Air Force base in southern Nevada. It's long been a topic of fascination for conspiracy theorists and paranormal enthusiasts who believe it to be the location where the US government stores and hides alien bodies and UFOs. Just this week, the US Navy acknowledged that some videos of UFO s are indeed images of objects that can't be identified.

Roberts said he came up with the idea for the meme page after podcaster Joe Rogan interviewed Area 51 whistleblower Bob Lazar and filmmaker Jeremy Corbell. Lazar claims that he worked with an alien spacecraft while he was employed in one of Area 51's underground facilities.

CNN's Nick Watt explores the ""Storm Area 51"" event that took social media by storm, and how the locals plan to respond to an influx of alien enthusiasts to their town.

The Air Force didn't see the joke in any of this and promised to stand ""ready to protect America and its assets,"" so Roberts switched tactics. He started promoting a music festival, Alienstock, to be held this weekend in Rachel, Nevada, one of the closest towns to the base. But he pulled out of the festival last week, because he feared it would turn into a ""humanitarian disaster.""

""Due to the lack of infrastructure, poor planning, risk management and blatant disregard for the safety of the expected 10,000+ AlienStock attendees, we decided to pull the plug on the festival,"" he wrote on a website for the festival. (Roberts set up a separate festival, the Area 51 Celebration , in downtown Las Vegas.)

But Alienstock will go on in Rachel, as well as other events in the nearby town of Hiko, and that's what has local officials worried. They're afraid that some people really will try to ""storm"" the desert base or put themselves in danger trying.

There are not enough accommodations

Local authorities and the community spent the past few weeks preparing for Friday.

Rachel has a population of 54 and is surrounded by ghost towns and desert. The town boasts only four businesses in its city limits, and the Little A'Le'Inn is the only one that provides lodging and food.

According to its website, the inn is ""booked solid."" The inn has 14 rooms, and camping space is now the last available option.

Early Friday, the sheriff's office reported there were 2,000 people in Rachel. There were another 250 were in Hiko.

""Vehicle traffic is starting to get heavy coming in to the area,"" the sheriff's office said . ""Please use extreme caution and plan ahead for delays in travel.""

To make matters worse, Rachel's only gas station closed in 2006, so visitors will have to fill their tanks 50 miles away in Alamo, Nevada.

Washington CNN —

In a landmark opinion, a divided Supreme Court on Friday ruled that same-sex couples can marry nationwide, establishing a new civil right and handing gay rights advocates a historic victory.

In the 5-4 ruling, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority with the four liberal justices. Each of the four conservative justices wrote their own dissent.

Nearly 46 years to the day after a riot at New York’s Stonewall Inn ushered in the modern gay rights movement, the decision could settle one of the major civil rights fights of this era. The language of Kennedy’s opinion spoke eloquently of the most fundamental values of family, love and liberty.

READ: The Supreme Court’s full decision

“No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family,” Kennedy wrote. “In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than they once were.”

’Equal dignity in the eyes of the law’

“Their hope,” Kennedy wrote, “is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.”

Kennedy has written the opinion in significant gay rights cases and when he uttered the key sentence that same-sex couples should be able to exercise the right to marry in all states, people in the Court’s public gallery broke into smiles and some wiped tears from their eyes.

Reaction: People soak up history from coast to coast

In a dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia blasted the Court’s “threat to American democracy.”

“The substance of today’s decree is not of immense personal importance to me,” he wrote. “But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today’s judicial Putsch.”

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the decision had “nothing to do with the Constitution.”

“If you are among the many Americans—of whatever sexual orientation—who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today’s decision. Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal,” he wrote. “Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it.”

The U.S. is now the 21st country to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, including territories. Married same-sex couples will now enjoy the same legal rights and benefits as married heterosexual couples nationwide and will be recognized on official documents such as birth and death certificates.

Hundreds of same-sex marriage supporters flooded the plaza and sidewalk in front of the Court to celebrate the ruling, proudly waving rainbow flags and banners with the Human Rights Campaign’s equal sign, which have come to represent the gay rights movement. In an emotional moment, the supporters sang the National Anthem, clapping wildly after singing that the U.S. is “the land of the free.”

WATCH: Obama calls gay marriage case plaintiff Jim Obergefell

After the ruling, President Barack Obama called Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the case, while he and his supporters celebrated the ruling outside the court.

Obama: ‘Congratulations’

“I just wanted to say congratulations,” Obama said as CNN broadcast his warm words to Obergefell over speakerphone. He added: “Your leadership on this has changed the country.”

01:58 - Source: CNN Obama calls same-sex marriage plaintiff after victory

Speaking at the White House later in the morning, Obama said “Americans should be very proud,” because small acts of courage “slowly made an entire country realize that love is love.”

By the numbers: Same-sex marriage

The decision affirmed growing public support in the U.S. for gay marriage, with about two-thirds of Americans now in favor. And it comes as gay rights groups have seen gay marriage bans fall rapidly in recent years, with the number of states allowing gay marriage swelling most recently to 37 – that is, until this ruling.

There were two questions before the Court, the first asked whether states could ban same sex marriage, the second asked whether states had to recognize lawful marriages performed out of state.

The relevant cases were argued earlier this year. Attorney John Bursch, serving as Michigan’s Special Assistant Attorney General, defended four states’ bans on gay marriage before the Court, arguing that the case was not about how to define marriage, but rather about who gets to decide the question.

The case came before the Supreme Court after several lower courts overturned state bans on gay marriage. A federal appeals court had previously ruled in favor of the state bans, with Judge Jeffrey Sutton of the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals writing a majority opinion in line with the rationale that the issue should be decided through the political process, not the courts.

14 couples

Fourteen couples and two widowers challenged the bans. Attorneys Mary Bonauto and Doug Hallward-Driemeier presented their case before the Court, arguing that the freedom to marry is a fundamental right for all people and should not be left to popular vote.

Three years after Obama first voiced his support for gay couples’ right to marry, his administration supported the same sex couples at the Supreme Court.

“Gay and lesbian people are equal,” Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. told the justices at the oral arguments earlier this year. “It is simply untenable – untenable – to suggest that they can be denied the right of equal participation in an institution of marriage, or that they can be required to wait until the majority decides that it is ready to treat gay and lesbian people as equals.

MAP: Where same-sex marriage is recognized in the U.S.

Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the case, married his spouse John Arthur in 2013 months before Arthur died.

The couple, who lived in Ohio, had to travel to Maryland aboard a medical jet to get married when Arthur became gravely ill. And when Arthur died, Obergefell began to fight to be recognized as Arthur’s spouse on his death certificate.

The plaintiffs from Michigan are April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, two Detroit-area nurses who are also foster parents. They took to the courts after they took in four special-needs newborns who were either abandoned or surrendered at birth, but could not jointly adopt the children because Michigan’s adoption code requires that couples be married to adopt.

Milestones for LGBT rights

Sgt. Ijpe Dekoe and Thomas Kostura became plaintiffs in the gay marriage case after they moved to Tennessee from New York.

The pair had married in New York in 2011, but Dekoe’s position in the Army took the couple to Tennessee, which banned gay marriage and refused to recognize gay marriages performed in other states.

2016

Republicans seeking the White House struggled to find their footing after the ruling.

Candidates running closer to the center, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, issued tightly-parsed language urging their colleagues to focus on protecting “religious freedom”. And Ohio Gov. John Kasich urged Republicans to respect the ruling and ditch the matter altogether.

“In a country as diverse as ours, good people who have opposing views should be able to live side by side. It is now crucial that as a country we protect religious freedom and the right of conscience and also not discriminate,” Bush said in his statement.

READ: Roberts vs. Scalia in Obamacare bout

But conservative firebrands, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, said that conservatives must stand and fight by seeking a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.

“I will not acquiesce to an imperial court any more than our founders acquiesced to an imperial British monarch. We must resist and reject judicial tyranny, not retreat,” Huckabee said in a statement.

Democrats had no problem reacting, jumping fast on Twitter to express their universal elation.

CNN,Trump Inauguration,Inauguration Day 2017: Historic moment arrives,"Washington CNN —

Donald Trump became the 45th President of the United States on Friday, vowing to drain power from Washington elites and always put “America first” in its dealings with the world at a moment of transformative political change.

He arrived at the White House for the first time as President just before 5 p.m. ET following a day of tradition marking the power shift in the nation’s capital.

In a time-honored ceremony on the flag-draped West Front of the Capitol earlier in the afternoon, Trump placed his left hand on a family Bible and another that belonged to Abraham Lincoln and promised to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. As light rain began to fall on a crowd stretching toward the Washington Monument, Trump took the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts with the new first lady, Melania, by his side.

President Trump signs first bill into law

Trump’s inaugural address centered on the themes that animated his stunning outsider campaign, which shattered political conventions and gave voice to heartland voters who felt badly let down by professional politicians.

Though he paid tribute to outgoing President Barack Obama, the President sketched a vision of America that came across as a repudiation of the last administration. He promised to restore the nation’s strength and purpose and to rebuild it from within, vowing to “bring back” American jobs, borders, wealth and dreams.

Trump: ‘You will never be ignored again’

“We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, and in every foreign capital and in every hall of power,” Trump said. “From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land, from this day forward, it’s going to be only ‘America first! America first!’”

Trump talked of a nation of mothers and children trapped in poverty in the inner cities and “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones,” and warned crime and gangs had robbed the nation of much of its potential.

Trump’s full speech

“This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,” Trump said, with Obama looking on.

“A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights and heal our divisions,” Trump said, emphasizing that whether people are black or white they still bleed the same red blood of patriots.

And he told Americans listening to the address: “You will never be ignored again.”

Former Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter attended the ceremony. Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated in the November election, was in the audience in a show of support for national unity and the peaceful transfer of presidential authority.

But, contrary to some expectations, Trump made no gesture of reconciliation toward Clinton or her supporters following the deeply divisive campaign in which he won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote. He later recognized her during a congressional lunch, when she received a standing ovation.

“I was very honored, very, very honored when I heard that President Bill Clinton and Secretary Hillary Clinton was coming today, I think it is appropriate to say it,” Trump said. “Honestly, there is nothing more I can say because I have a lot of respect for those two people.”

Many traditions

The swearing-in was one of many traditions that began Friday morning. Trump and his family attended a private worship service at St. John’s Episcopal Church, known as the church of presidents. The Obamas greeted Trump and the new first lady at the North Portico of the White House before hosting them for tea.

Earlier in the morning, Obama wrote a letter to Trump and left it on the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, as outgoing presidents typically do for their successors. As Obama left the Oval Office for the final time, he was asked whether he had any words for the American people. “Thank you,” Obama responded.

The customs and symbolism that are playing out – from Trump’s ride to the Capitol with Obama to the first couple’s dance at an inaugural ball – are familiar. But the circumstances of this inauguration – the 58th in the nation’s history – could hardly be more unconventional.

Everything you need to know about Trump’s inauguration, weekend protests

When the presidential primary season began nearly a year ago, few thought Trump could survive the battle for the Republican nomination – much less beat Clinton to win the presidency. He was the oldest president sworn in for a first term and the first president with no previous diplomatic, political or military executive experience.

In what is always a poignant moment, the former President Obama and his wife left Capitol Hill on a helicopter bound for Joint Base Andrews for a farewell ceremony before taking one last flight on the presidential jet. The Obamas are heading to Palm Springs, California, for a vacation.

Trump attended a joint congressional inaugural luncheon in the Capitol before heading back to the White House for the inaugural parade. Halfway along Pennsylvania Avenue, Trump’s vehicle stopped and the new first couple walked hand in hand past the cheering crowds. By the time the motorcade approached the new Trump hotel, the President was back in the hulking car.

In the evening, Trump and the new first lady will attend two inaugural balls, part of the stripped-down inaugural festivities that aides say are meant to stress that the new president is eager to get to work.

Supporters excited; others concerned

Trump’s supporters, who sent him to Washington to rip up political norms and thwart the establishment, are thrilled as he assumes power. The crowds started streaming toward the National Mall as dawn broke, with many people wearing Trump’s distinctive red “Make America Great Again” baseball caps.

Day One: Trump says he will sign ‘very meaningful’ documents amid talk of executive orders

But millions of Americans are also anxious, owing to the abrasive tone of Trump’s campaign and fears over the consequences of his strongman leadership style.

Trump has vowed to tear up US trade deals that he says disadvantage US workers, confront a rising China and improve estranged relations with Russia, despite allegations that Moscow interfered in the election. He has set high expectations for his presidency by promising to return jobs to US shores and reviving the manufacturing industry. He has pledged to crush ISIS and introduce tough new vetting on immigrants from countries where there is terrorist activity, raising fears of discrimination against Muslims.

Trump is promising to build a wall on the southern border, to crack down on undocumented migrants and to gut the financial and environmental regulations that are at the center of the Obama administration’s legacy.

New presidents typically use the inaugural address – viewed by a huge crowd fanned out on the National Mall and millions of television viewers – to issue a call for national unity and ease the wounds of divisive elections. They typically remind Americans of the values and the history that binds them and of the nation’s historic mission.

Trump, so far, has done little to reach out to his foes since November.

“He is still talking as if he is the insurgent candidate rather than the President-elect,” said Robert Rowland, an expert on presidential rhetoric at the University of Kansas. “Historically, presidents who are effective use inaugural addresses to heal the wounds of the campaign, to talk about what it means to be an American, to discuss shared values and lay out their political principles to come across as a strong not vain leader.”",https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/politics/donald-trump-inauguration-highlights/index.html

Story highlights Clinton outpaced Trump by almost 2.9 million votes She lost the Electoral College, however

CNN —

More Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than any other losing presidential candidate in US history.

The Democrat outpaced President-elect Donald Trump by almost 2.9 million votes, with 65,844,954 (48.2%) to his 62,979,879 (46.1%), according to revised and certified final election results from all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Clinton’s 2.1% margin ranks third among defeated candidates, according to statistics from US Elections Atlas. Andrew Jackson won by more than 10% in 1824 but was denied the presidency, which went to John Quincy Adams. In 1876, Samuel Tilden received 3% more votes than Rutherford B. Hayes, who eventually triumphed by one electoral vote.

Though the legitimacy of his victory has never come into serious doubt, Trump has repeatedly argued, usually via Twitter, that he would have won the popular vote, too, if that had been his focus.

“I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote – but would campaign differently,” he tweeted as recently as Wednesday morning, more than six weeks after the election. In late November, Trump also falsely claimed that “millions” of Clinton voters had cast ballots “illegally.”

Meanwhile, high-profile Clinton supporters have held up the dissonant results as an argument for fundamentally changing the system.

A week after the election, retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat and vocal Clinton backer, introduced a bill to abolish the Electoral College.

“This is the only office in the land where you can get more votes and still lose the presidency,” Boxer said in a statement. “The Electoral College is an outdated, undemocratic system that does not reflect our modern society, and it needs to change immediately.”

Two days later, New York Congressman Charlie Rangel put forth companion legislation in the House of Representatives.

Measuring the electoral margin

In the final count, Clinton surpassed President Barack Obama’s 2012 total by 389,944 votes, but narrow losses in key battleground states meant Obama won 100 more electoral votes on Election Day.

Trump’s victories in swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida – all carried by Obama four years ago – gave him a comfortable edge in the Electoral College. Still, Trump’s claims of a “massive landslide victory” are belied by past statistics, which place his win among the narrowest.

If all the electors had voted in accordance with their states’ results during meetings on Monday, Trump would have garnered 56.9% – or 306 – of the 538 available electoral votes. Two defections lowered his final share to 56.5%. Clinton won 232 electoral votes on November 8, but “faithless electors” also brought down her total.

The 2016 electoral votes will be counted on January 6 by a Joint Session of Congress, with Vice President Joe Biden presiding over the largely symbolic meeting.

Washington CNN —

President Donald Trump has nominated Brett Kavanaugh to join the US Supreme Court, setting the stage for a dramatic confirmation battle over a stalwart conservative who could shape the direction of the court for decades to come.

If confirmed, Kavanaugh would replace a frequent swing vote on the bench, retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, who often sided with his liberal colleagues on issues such as abortion, affirmative action and LGBT rights.

Kavanaugh, 53, is a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and Yale Law School graduate who previously served in both Bush administrations. He also worked on independent counsel Ken Starr’s investigation of President Bill Clinton.

“What matters is not a judge’s political views, but whether they can set aside those views to do what the law and the Constitution require. I am pleased to say I have found without doubt such a person,” Trump said as he announced Kavanaugh’s nomination at the White House Monday evening.

Trump called Kavanaugh “one of the finest and sharpest legal minds of our time,” saying he is “considered a judge’s judge and a true thought leader among his peers.”

“Judge Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials, unsurpassed qualifications and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law,” Trump said.

Kavanaugh will begin meeting with senators on Tuesday.

He has never expressed outright opposition to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which made abortion legal nationwide, and similarly has no record on gay rights and same-sex marriage, but he will face tough questions from Democrats on both issues. Kavanaugh has also suggested that presidents be shielded from civil and criminal litigation until they leave office, an issue that could be front and center as Trump faces the investigations by special counsel Robert Mueller and potential civil challenges.

“If confirmed by the Senate, I will keep an open mind in every case,” Kavanaugh said Monday at the White House.

The nomination is Trump’s second to the nation’s highest court, a rare presidential privilege that could seal a key part of Trump’s legacy less than two years into his first term.

GOP hoping for quick confirmation

Trump last week spoke with seven candidates, all drawn from a shortlist compiled by the conservative Federalist Society, about the Supreme Court. The nomination also comes just before the President leaves for a critical trip to Britain, a NATO summit in Belgium and a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The White House is hoping the Senate moves quickly to confirm Kavanaugh before the midterm elections in November threaten to unfurl the narrow Republican majority in the chamber and nix the precious leverage the GOP holds over some red state Democrats up for reelection in 2018.

Trump’s legislative affairs director Marc Short told reporters Monday night that the White House expects a confirmation vote before October 1, when the new Supreme Court term begins.

Democrats are warning that Trump’s nominee would jeopardize some of progressives’ most important policy priorities in recent decades – including rulings that legalized abortion and same-sex marriage, as well as former President Barack Obama’s health care law.

Republicans hold 51 seats in the Senate, though Arizona Sen. John McCain has been absent as he battles brain cancer. Trump’s nominee can win confirmation with only Republican votes, but attention will quickly shift to two moderate GOP senators, Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, who are supportive of abortion rights.

Trump also hopes to pressure several Democrats into voting to confirm his nominee. Three Democrats up for re-election in states Trump won by double digits in 2016 – Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp – voted “yes” on the confirmation of his first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, who once held a court seat open for nearly a year before the 2016 election to keep President Barack Obama from filling it, lambasted Democrats for announcing their opposition before Trump had decided on a nominee.

“Justice Kennedy’s resignation letter barely arrived in the President’s hands before several Democratic colleagues began declaring their blanket opposition to anyone at all – anyone – that the President might name,” McConnell said Monday.

The sharply negative Democratic responses to Kavanaugh’s nomination indicated a pitched battle over his confirmation is coming this fall.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that by selecting Kavanaugh, Trump “has put reproductive rights and freedoms and health care protections for millions of Americans on the judicial chopping block.”

“This nomination could alter the balance of the court in favor of powerful special interests and against working families for a generation, and would take away labor, civil, and human rights from millions of Americans. We cannot let that happen,” the New York Democrat said.

Red-state Democrats keep their distance

Trump had invited four Democrats from deep-red states – likely the four best chances the White House has of attracting Democratic votes for Kavanaugh – to Monday night’s announcement.

But Alabama’s Sen. Doug Jones, Indiana’s Sen. Joe Donnelly, North Dakota’s Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and West Virginia’s Sen. Joe Manchin all declined the invitations.

Donnelly, Heitkamp and Manchin are up for re-election this fall, three of the five Democrats, along with Missouri’s Sen. Claire McCaskill and Montana’s Sen. Jon Tester, up for re-election in states Trump won by double digits in 2016.

Most of those Democrats issued tepid statements saying they will review Kavanaugh’s record, without commenting on whether they will vote for or against his confirmation – a position that breaks with their party’s progressive flank, which is demanding an all-out battle, but also doesn’t promise Trump any Democratic votes.

Donnelly said he would “carefully review and consider the record and qualifications.” Tester said he looks forward to meeting Kavanaugh and called on senators in both parties to “put politics aside and do what’s best for this nation.”

Moderate Republicans also held their fire. Collins said she is waiting for Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and to meet the nominee in her office.

“I will conduct a careful, thorough vetting of the President’s nominee to the Supreme Court, as I have done with the five previous Supreme Court Justices whom I have considered,” she said in a statement.

Veteran of DC

Kavanaugh is a classic Washington insider with a deep conservative legal record.

He worked in the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, serving the younger president when he was torn among finalists for a Supreme Court seat in 2005.

He also spent 12 years on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where his record would place him to Kennedy’s right and more in ideological sync with Justice Samuel Alito, who has been a reliable conservative vote on the court.

Last October, Kavanaugh dissented when the full DC Circuit prevented the Trump administration from blocking a pregnant teenage migrant at the southern border from obtaining an abortion. Kavanaugh stressed that the “government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of a minor, and refraining from facilitating abortion.”

George W. Bush praised Trump’s selection of Kavanaugh in a statement, calling his selection an “outstanding decision.”

“Brett is a brilliant jurist who has faithfully applied the Constitution and laws throughout his 12 years on the D.C. Circuit. He is a fine husband, father, and friend – and a man of the highest integrity,” Bush said. “He will make a superb justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.”

At the White House, Kavanaugh described his mother as influential in his legal path. After teaching high school history, she went to law school, became a prosecutor and later a state court judge during his youth, and he said he thinks of her as the real “Judge Kavanaugh.”

“Her trademark line was, ‘Use your common sense – what rings true, what rings false.’ That’s good advice for a juror and for a son,” he said.

Says presidents should be shielded from litigation while in office

No stranger to controversy, including on issues that resonate today, Kavanaugh worked for Starr’s investigation of Clinton in the 1990s. That initial Whitewater real estate inquiry expanded into an investigation of Clinton’s relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

The then 33-year-old Kavanaugh became a lead author of the 1998 Starr Report that detailed Clinton’s sexual involvement with Lewinsky and laid out 11 grounds for Clinton’s impeachment, including obstruction of justice and lying under oath. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives voted to impeach Clinton, but the GOP-controlled Senate acquitted him in 1999.

A decade later, after Kavanaugh had worked closely with George W. Bush, he wrote in a law review that he had new appreciation for the demands of the presidency and the toll any legal proceeding could take on the White House. He recommended presidents be shielded from civil and criminal litigation until they leave office.

“Having seen first-hand how complex and difficult that job is,” he wrote, “I believe it vital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible.” He acknowledged that blocking litigation would suggest the President was “above the law,” but he added, “the point is not to put the President above the law or to eliminate checks on the President, but simply to defer litigation and investigations until the President is out of office.”

Kavanaugh noted in the 2009 Minnesota Law Review piece that a check against a “bad-behaving or law-breaking President” would still exist. “If the President does something dastardly, the impeachment process is available.”

CNN,George Floyd Death,"As heated protests over George Floyd's death continue, Minnesota governor warns of 'extremely dangerous situation'","b'Minneapolis (CNN)Hundreds remained on the streets of Minneapolis late Wednesday night protesting the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died after pleading for help as a police officer pinned him to the ground with his knee on Floyd\'s neck.\r\n\r\nThe demonstrations, which began Wednesday, were initially peaceful but turned ""extremely dangerous,"" according to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\r\n""The situation near Lake Street and Hiawatha in Minneapolis has evolved into an extremely dangerous situation,"" Walz said on Twitter. ""For everyone\'s safety, please leave the area and allow firefighters and paramedics to get to the scene.""\r\nPolice officers created a barrier outside the police precinct that protesters have been targeting, smashing its windows by throwing items including water bottles. Authorities have responded by shooting tear gas.\r\nAcross the street from the precinct, the fire department was responding to an AutoZone store in flames, according to a CNN team on the ground. Groups of demonstrators looted and damaged stores in the surrounding areas, according to CNN\'s observations.\r\nAn attorney representing Floyd\'s family, Benjamin Crump, said in a statement Wednesday that he and Floyd\'s relatives are calling for peaceful protests and social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n""We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,"" the statement said. ""We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.""\r\nThe four officers involved in Floyd\'s death were fired from the department Tuesday, Minneapolis police said.\r\nThe officers involved in the incident were identified by Minneapolis police as: Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, according to the police website.\r\nAn attorney for Chauvin, says his client is the officer seen on video restraining Floyd with his knee. Tom Kelly says he will not yet be releasing a statement on Chauvin\'s behalf.\r\nThomas Plunkett, who is representing Kueng said, ""At this time, out of respect for Mr. Floyd, we are declining all invitations to discuss these painful events.""\r\nEarl Gray is representing another of the officers involved but has declined to say who his client is.\r\nCNN has not determined the attorney for the fourth officer.\r\nMinneapolis mayor calls for charges\r\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Wednesday called for criminal charges against the police officer who was seen pinning Floyd to the ground with his knee in an incident that is spurring street protests and local and federal investigations.\r\n""What I can say with certainty, based on what I saw, is that ... the officer who had his knee on the neck of George Floyd should be charged,"" Frey said in a news conference Wednesday.\r\nFrey declined to say what the officer should be charged with, and said his knowledge is ""limited to the video evidence that is there"" about Floyd, a black man. He said he made his opinion known to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, whose office would be in position to file state charges.\r\n""George Floyd deserves justice. His family deserves justice. The black community deserves justice, and our city deserves justice,"" Frey said.\r\nNo charges have been filed in the case.\r\nMinneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo declined to discuss Floyd\'s death on Wednesday but said the actions of the former police officers ""in no way reflect the values, and the vision and the culture"" he wants to change in the police department.\r\nOfficers should be charged with murder, family says\r\nFloyd worked security at Conga Latin Bistro in Minneapolis for five years, according to its owner, Jovanni Thunstrom.\r\nThe 46-year-old Houston native moved to Minneapolis for work and to drive trucks, his friend and former NBA player, Stephen Jackson said.\r\nMembers of Floyd\'s family remembered him as a man who wouldn\'t ""hurt anybody."" The family wants the four officers charged with murder.\r\n""They were supposed to be there to serve and to protect and I didn\'t see a single one of them lift a finger to do anything to help while he was begging for his life. Not one of them tried to do anything to help him,"" Tera Brown, Floyd\'s cousin, told CNN\'s Don Lemon on Tuesday.\r\n\'I can\'t breathe\'\r\nFloyd was arrested Monday evening after officers responded to a call about an alleged forgery in progress.\r\nThe officers were told the suspect was sitting on top of a blue car, Minneapolis police say, and found Floyd inside a car when they arrived.\r\nPolice said he ""physically resisted"" after he got out of the vehicle. Officers handcuffed Floyd, who police said ""appeared to be suffering medical distress.""\r\nVideo from bystanders shows Floyd handcuffed and Chauvin with his knee pressed against the neck of the 46-year-old. Two officers handled the man on the ground while another stood nearby with his eyes on the bystanders as traffic passed.\r\n""Please, I can\'t breathe,"" Floyd says. ""... My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Everything hurts.""\r\nAt one point the Floyd said, ""Give me some water or something. Please. Please.""\r\nSurveillance video obtained from a nearby restaurant showed the first point of contact police had with the man. An officer escorts Floyd handcuffed out of a car and Floyd sits on the sidewalk. Moments later, the officer and another escort Floyd away, still with his hands behind his back.\r\nFloyd was declared dead at a nearby hospital shortly afterwards. A finding on the cause and manner of Floyd\'s death is pending and it is being investigated by local, state and federal law enforcement, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner\'s Office said.\r\nIn a statement on Tuesday, police said additional information had ""been made available"" and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had joined the investigation.\r\nThe FBI Minneapolis Division has said the federal investigation into Floyd\'s death will focus on whether the police officers ""willfully deprived (Floyd) of a right or privilege protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\r\nOfficers\' attorneys had represented other Minnesota officers in high-profile deaths\r\nThe Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis said Tuesday the four officers were cooperating in an investigation and urged ""now is not the time to rush to (judgment)"" while the officers\' actions are examined.\r\nAt least three of the fired officers are being represented by attorneys who previously represented other police officers involved in high-profile killings in Minnesota.\r\nChauvin\'s attorney, Kelly, represented then-St. Anthony police Officer Jeronimo Yanez, who shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights in July 2016. A jury found Yanez not guilty of manslaughter; Castile\'s family and his girlfriend reached settlements with various cities.\r\nGray, like Kelly, had represented Yanez.\r\nPlunkett was involved in the defense of Minneapolis police Officer Mohamed Noor, who was convicted of third-degree murder and manslaughter for shooting and killing Justine Ruszczyk while responding to her 911 call in July 2017.\r\nFloyd\'s death \'it\'s like d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu\'\r\nMonday\'s incident is forcing Gwen Carr to relive the death of her son Eric Garner, who also uttered the words ""I can\'t breathe"" while in a New York officer\'s chokehold.\r\n""It\'s hard enough we\'re coming up on the anniversary of my son\'s death, and now to hear about this young man, it\'s like d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu,"" Carr told CNN. ""It\'s just like the murder of my son all over again. He was basically the same age as Eric.""\r\nThe officer who choked Garner in 2014 never faced charges. He was fired in 2019 after being found guilty in a disciplinary trial of using a chokehold on Garner and later sued the city over his termination.\r\nNBA superstar LeBron James, Cleveland Browns player Odell Beckham Jr. and other athletes have voiced their outrage over Floyd\'s death.\r\n'",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/27/us/minneapolis-protests-george-floyd/index.html
CNN,Russia Invades Ukraine,"U.S. official says 1,000 Russian troops enter Ukraine","b'A top Ukrainian army officer said a ""full-scale invasion"" of his country was under way Thursday, as a U.S. official said up to 1,000 Russian troops had crossed Ukraine\'s southern border to fight alongside pro-Russian rebels.\r\nU.S. officials said Russian troops were directly involved in the latest fighting, despite Moscow\'s denials.\r\nRebels backed by Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers fought Ukrainian forces on two fronts Thursday: southeast of rebel-held Donetsk, and along the nation\'s southern coast in the town of Novoazovsk, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the Russian border, said Mykhailo Lysenko, the deputy commander of the Ukrainian Donbas battalion.\r\n""This is a full-scale invasion,"" Lysenko said, referring to the fighting in the south.\r\nIntelligence now indicates that up to 1,000 Russian troops have moved into southern Ukraine with heavy weapons and are fighting there, a U.S. official told CNN on Thursday.\r\nNATO provided what it said is evidence: satellite images showing Russian troops engaged in military operations inside Ukraine.\r\n""The images, captured in late August, depict Russian self-propelled artillery units moving in a convoy through the Ukrainian countryside and then preparing for action by establishing firing positions in the area of Krasnodon, Ukraine,"" NATO said in a news release.\r\nSee the NATO satellite images\r\nCommercial satellite imagery shows the same, according to a British security source with detailed knowledge of UK intelligence estimates. One image that British intelligence has analyzed, dated Tuesday, shows 15 heavy trucks, at least seven armored vehicles and at least nine artillery positions.\r\nRussia\'s military actions in eastern Ukraine ""must cease immediately,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday.\r\n""I\'m extremely concerned by mounting evidence that Russian troops have made large-scale incursions into South Eastern Ukraine, completely disregarding the sovereignty of a neighbor,"" Cameron said. ""The international community has already warned Russia that such provocative actions would be completely unacceptable and illegal.""\r\nAs the Russian presence grows, so does its influence over the separatist leadership in Ukraine, the British security source told CNN.\r\nAccording to the source, the UK has determined that Russian artillery and rockets -- across the border and from within Ukraine -- have been fired against the Ukrainian military.\r\nTwo SA-22A gun/missile air defense systems were observed in separatist-controlled parts of Luhansk province on August 2, the source said. This system is not in Ukraine\'s inventory but is used by the Russian military.\r\nUkraine\'s National Defense and Security Council said that Russian forces were in full control of Novoazovsk as of Wednesday afternoon.\r\nRussia\'s military fired Grad rockets into the town and its suburbs before sending in two convoys of tanks and armored personnel carriers from Russia\'s Rostov region, it said in a statement\r\n""Ukrainian troops were ordered to pull out to save their lives. By late afternoon both Russian convoys had entered the town. Ukraine is now fortifying nearby Mariupol to the west,"" the NDSC said.\r\nA number of villages in the Novoazovsk, Starobeshiv and Amvrosiiv districts were also seized, it said.\r\nThe NDSC also warned that a rebel counterattack is expected in the area where Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in July. Ukrainian and Western officials say they believe it was downed by rebels armed with Russian-made weapons.\r\nNovoazovsk is strategically important because it lies on the main road leading from the Russian border to Ukraine\'s Crimea region, which Russia annexed in March. Separatist leaders in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions then declared independence from Kiev.\r\nU.N. Security Council meets\r\nAs international concern mounted over the apparent escalation in fighting, the U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting on Ukraine.\r\nSamantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, accused Russia of lying.\r\n""It has manipulated. It has obfuscated. It has outright lied. So we have learned to measure Russia by its actions and not by its words,"" Power said, calling for ""serious negotiations.""\r\n""In the face of this threat, the cost of inaction is unacceptable,"" she warned.\r\nAccording to Vitaly Churkin, Russia\'s ambassador to the United Nations, more than 2,000 people have been killed in the conflict and more than 800,000 have been displaced.\r\nHe blamed the current escalation on the ""reckless policy"" of Kiev.\r\n""The Kiev authorities have torpedoed all political agreements on resolving the crisis,"" Churkin told the Security Council meeting. ""The only thing we\'re seeing is a fight against dissent.""\r\nUkraine\'s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, meanwhile, put his colleagues on alert.\r\n""The world is challenged by a military-nuclear might, ignoring universal principles and craving absolute power,"" Oleksandr Pavlichenko said about Russia. ""How many more red lines have to be crossed before this challenge is addressed?"" he asked.\r\nThe latest flare-up comes despite a meeting between Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Belarus on Tuesday at which some progress appeared to have been made toward finding a diplomatic solution to the crisis.\r\nPoroshenko canceled a planned trip to Turkey on Thursday ""due to sharp aggravation of the situation in Donetsk region ... as Russian troops were brought into Ukraine,"" a statement from his office said.\r\nIn a Cabinet meeting, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said that Russia ""has very much increased its military presence in Ukraine"" and that tougher measures may be needed to curb Russia\'s support for the rebels.\r\n""Unfortunately, the sanctions were unhelpful as to de-escalating the situation in Ukraine,"" he said, referring to the economic sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union against Russian individuals and companies.\r\nYatsenyuk suggested one way to halt ""Russian aggression"" could be to freeze all assets and ban all Russian bank transactions until Russia ""pulls out all its military, equipment and agents"" from Ukraine.\r\n""Vladimir Putin has purposely started a war in Europe. It is impossible to hide from the fact,"" he said.\r\nPresident Barack Obama, similarly, placed blame for the violence in Ukraine on Russia.\r\n""The violence is encouraged by Russia. The separatists are trained by Russia; they are armed by Russia; they are funded by Russia,"" he told reporters in Washington.\r\nCalling sanctions against Russia already in place ""effective,"" he said it would face additional costs and consequences for its ongoing incursion.\r\n""Russia is already more isolated than at any time since the end of the Cold War,"" Obama said.\r\nU.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the flow of weapons is hindering efforts.\r\n""This remains a key obstacle to the de-escalation of the situation on the ground, as arms and heavy weaponry reportedly continue to flow unabated into Ukraine from Russia,"" Ban said. ""There is an urgent need to ensure a secure border between the two countries, with international verification.""\r\nU.S. ambassador: Russia is directly involved\r\nU.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt also said Thursday that Russian soldiers were directly involved in the fighting, alongside the pro-Russian rebels.\r\n""Russian-supplied tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and multiple rocket launchers have been insufficient to defeat Ukraine\'s armed forces, so now an increasing number of Russian troops are intervening directly in the fighting on Ukrainian territory,"" he said on Twitter.\r\n""Russia has also sent its newest air defense systems including the SA-22 into eastern Ukraine and is now directly involved in the fighting.""\r\nMoscow denies supporting and arming the pro-Russian rebels. It has also repeatedly denied allegations by Kiev that it has sent troops over the border.\r\nA Russian senator and the deputy head of the Committee on Defense and Security in Russia\'s upper house of Parliament, Evgeny Serebrennikov, dismissed the latest reports of a Russian incursion as untrue.\r\n""We\'ve heard many statements from the government of Ukraine, which turned out to be a lie. What we can see now is just another lie,"" he said to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.\r\nRussian lawmaker Leonid Slutsky also accused Kiev of lies, in comments to RIA Novosti.\r\n""I can only say that there\'s no ground for claims like this, and the junta tries to lay its own fault at someone else\'s door,"" he said, referring to the Kiev government.\r\nMoscow regards it as illegitimate because it took charge after Ukraine\'s pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in February.\r\nRussian soldiers detained in Ukraine; leaders meet in Minsk\r\nRebel leader: 3,000 to 4,000 Russians in our ranks\r\nHowever, the Prime Minister of the self-declared Donetsk People\'s Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, acknowledged Thursday that there are current Russian servicemen fighting in the rebels\' ranks in eastern Ukraine.\r\nIn his statement, televised on state-run Russia 24, Zakharchenko said the rebels have never concealed that many Russians are fighting with them. He said up until now there were 3,000 to 4,000 volunteers, some of whom are retired Russian servicemen.\r\nZakharchenko went on to reveal that the Russian servicemen currently fighting in their ranks are active, ""as they came to us to struggle for our freedom instead of their vacations.""\r\nOn Tuesday, Ukraine\'s Security Service said it had detained 10 Russian soldiers in Ukraine.\r\nRussian state media cited a source in the Russian Defense Ministry as saying the soldiers had been patrolling the border and ""most likely crossed by accident"" at an unmarked point.\r\nThe NDSC said Thursday that Ukraine\'s Security Service detained another Russian serviceman who testified that his unit was supplying heavy military equipment to militants.\r\nSix questions -- what\'s happening in Ukraine?\r\nSeparately, Ukraine announced Thursday that it would reinstate compulsory military service in the fall. Fresh recruits will not be sent to the country\'s area of conflict in the east, Mihaylo Koval, the deputy secretary of the National Defense and Security Council, told reporters.\r\nUkrainian volunteers retreat from Mariupol area\r\nPro-Kiev forces apparently already have engaged with rebel forces between Novoazovsk and Mariupol, the Sea of Azov port city 35 kilometers (22 miles) to the west that the country\'s security council said was being fortified.\r\nA CNN crew north of Mariupol saw a ragged convoy of about 25 vehicles, some with their windows smashed out, belonging to pro-Kiev volunteer fighters heading away from the city Thursday afternoon.\r\nThe volunteers, including two from the country of Georgia, said they\'d been involved in fighting in the Mariupol area but didn\'t provide details.\r\nEarlier Thursday and farther north, the CNN crew was near Donetsk city, which Ukrainian forces have been trying to wrest from rebels for weeks. Heavy Ukrainian artillery fire targeted areas near Donetsk\'s southern suburbs amid a heavy downpour of rain.\r\nThe main highway 9 miles (15 kilometers) south of Donetsk was deserted. With return fire coming from Donetsk, villagers in the area said they\'d been taking shelter indoors or underground, coming out only for an hour or two a day to get supplies.\r\nThe city of Luhansk, a rebel stronghold, has also been at the center of fighting for days, prompting a humanitarian crisis. The NDSC said it remained without water, power or phone connections Thursday.\r\n'",https://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/28/world/europe/ukraine-crisis/index.html
