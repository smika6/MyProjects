Kiev and its Western backers accused Moscow of sending Russian troops and armor to fight alongside rebels in eastern Ukraine, dimming hopes for a diplomatic solution to the crisis and prompting the U.S. and Europe to threaten new sanctions.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko convened an emergency meeting of his security chiefs Thursday and vowed that "Ukraine can defend itself."

He dispatched troops to meet the Russian-backed advance as his government ordered the reinstatement of a draft this fall—though it pledged not to send conscripts into the war zone.

But while officials in Kiev called on Western capitals for support, including military aid, the initial reaction from the U.S. and Europe included expressions of frustration with the Kremlin but no immediate action.

President Barack Obama ruled out a U.S. military response but said that the escalating incursion into Ukraine would bring more costs for Moscow.

Military equipment that NATO says Russia has in the region:

Inside Ukraine, operated by Russians or separatists: self-propelled artillery, air defense systems, tanks, armored vehicles, rocket launchers, armored personnel carriers.
Russian equipment positioned in Russia, near the border: T-72 tanks; 153mm 2S19 self-propelled artillery; combat aircraft; armored personnel carriers.

Western leaders have for months said a Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine would prompt harsher economic sanctions and international isolation on Russia. But President Obama has also made clear that the U.S. and its allies won't intervene militarily to stop Russian forces.

Kiev's military, underequipped and heavily reliant on poorly trained volunteer units, would be no match for a major force from Russia.

If threats of more Western sanctions failed to deter Moscow, Kiev would likely be forced to agree to a cease-fire that left the separatists—and their sponsors in Russia—in control of a substantial part of Ukraine.

That would be a dramatic setback for Mr. Poroshenko's pro-Western government and a severe blow to Ukraine's already-shrinking economy, as well as a threat to his ambitions for closer ties with the European Union and U.S.

Western nations have grown increasingly alarmed. Speaking before French ambassadors in Paris, President François Hollande said any incursion by Russian troops inside Ukraine would be "intolerable" and warned that Moscow would expose itself to a new round of sanctions if it didn't respect the sovereignty of its western neighbor.

"Russia cannot simultaneously aspire to be a world power in the 21st century and not play by the rules," the French president said.

But it is unclear how big an appetite European countries have for more sanctions on Russia, a major trading partner, with economies on the continent already slowing.

The EU had hoped that diplomatic efforts, which led to a meeting in Minsk, Belarus, on Tuesday between Messrs. Poroshenko and Putin, would lead to a negotiated settlement. But the latest developments made that prospect seem remote.

After falling back before the advance in the southeast, Ukrainian troops are now digging in near the strategically important port city of Mariupol, which had been one of the first Kiev reclaimed from rebels earlier this year. The Russian news agency Interfax cited pro-Russian rebels as saying they will be taking the city "in the coming days."

Ukraine's security council said the assault on Novoazovsk on Wednesday was preceded by missile fire from across the Russian border, followed by the incursion of "two columns of Russian military equipment."

The council said Russian forces had taken control of Novoazovsk and surrounding villages, as well as villages further north, toward Donetsk.

At the main roadblock on the road east from Mariupol, a few dozen pro-Kiev soldiers and volunteers armed with rifles stood at the post of concrete blocks with two armored vehicles. They were digging trenches, but several despaired at what they said was lack of support, with no artillery or tanks to bolster their defensive position.

"What can we do with rifles against tanks?" asked one bearded fighter in his 20s.
