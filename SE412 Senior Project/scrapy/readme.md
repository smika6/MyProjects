### How to run scrapy/newspaper

In order to get scrapy to run, you need to run "scrapy crawl *spidername*"

For our case, I made a lot of spiders to kind of having "saving" points. That way I could easily roll back and run the spider again.

#### Run scrapy
1. Go to the "scrapy" directory (you should be in it now)
2. Now lets run the spiders
	- "scrapy crawl cnn1"
	- "scrapy crawl cnn2"
	- "scrapy crawl cnn3"
	- "scrapy crawl fox1"
	- "scrapy crawl nbc1"
	- "scrapy crawl nyp1"
	- "scrapy crawl wsj1"
	- "scrapy crawl wsj2"
	- "scrapy crawl wsj3"
	- "scrapy crawl wsj4"
	- "scrapy crawl wsj5"
	- "scrapy crawl wsj6"
	- "scrapy crawl wsj7"
	- "scrapy crawl wsj8"
	- "scrapy crawl wsj9"
	- "scrapy crawl wsj10"
	- "scrapy crawl wsj11"
